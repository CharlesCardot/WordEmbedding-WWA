Muhammad Mkubwa was the ruler of the citystate of Ilya, Island off the coast of presentday Tanzania Little is known about her life or her, reign other than that her father and her brother ruled before her and her brothers, son succeeded her The may have become the ruler of Ilya as the eldest surviving child of Sultan Muhammad Mkubwa or she may have been serving as a, regent for her brothers son until he was old enough to assume leadership of the, sultanate In some other citystates rule was passed from mother to daughter In, the early 1800s for example Queen Mwanzuani succeeded her mother as ruler of, Pua on Mania Island and in the late 1800s Sabani into Gums the ruler of, Mikindani was succeeded by her daughter, , Scholars have document twentysix women rulers of the citystates along, thesEast African coast during the seventeenth eighteenthand nineteenth centuries and there may well have been more since the historical record in this area, remains incomplete The names of earlier women rulers became praise names for, individual citystates and these praise names were used in poetry to comment on, the communities and their inhabitants For example as explained by Ashamed, H Abdulaziz in his book Muyaka NineteenthCentury Swahili Popular Poetry the, Mombasa poet Muyaka bin Nasi referred to Mombasa as Gongwa of Want, Kiss Gongwa is an earlier name for Mombasa and Want Kiss is the, name of the legendary female ruler of Mombasa Similarly Muyaka referred to, the people of Zanzibar as the descendants of Want Eliza after the islands, legendary female ruler Abdulaziz also finds references in poetry to Want Size, of Same Want Musura of Late and Want Shamba Whale of Gumma, , In 1711 Sultan Intima composed a letter to Mwinyi Human whose father, seems to have been from Mombasa The ascribe whose name is not legible in the, manuscript wrote the letter in Swahili in Arabic script Both Swahili and Arabic, were used by the elite of the Swahili citystates during this period and it is likely, that Sultan Intima was literate in both languages While Arabic was used for, communication with Man officials and merchants and was also used along, with Portuguese for communication with Portuguese officials and merchants it, appears that Swahili written in Arabic script may often have been used for communications between Swahili citystates Messengers who traveled by how, transmitted letters from one citystate to another, , It the time Sultan Intima wrote her letter Portuguese control of the Last, African coast was waning and Man Arab dominance of the regionwas being, established In the letter Sultan Intima seems to indicate that she has established, an alliance with or accepted the protection of the ruler of Man Presumably, Portuguese officials intercepted the messenger confiscated the letter before it, reached Mwinyi Human and had it translated into Portuguese in their Boa headquarters by Want Day in alSayyid Mbwana Shake who identified himself in, his translation as a prince of Papa Island Papa Island is located off the northern, coast of Sonya and was another Swahili citystate, , Inn Biersteker]

memoir as a whole she, emerges as a courageous and singleminded rebel and provides what is probably, the first record of a Tanzanian woman of herstature denying the strict social, forms of her time place and position, , In the Zanzibar of Princess Talmas time it was quite unthinkable for, an upperclass Slim woman to marry a nonSlim let alone a foreigner, , 80  THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES, , Upperclass women in Zanzibar were usually secluded from the prying eyes of all, males other than their very close relatives They were required to hide themselves, whenever visitors entered the house and to be fully shrouded and escorted by, armed eunuchs and servant women whenever they went out It is thus difficult to, know how the young German businessman managed even to meet Talma let, alone come to an agreement to elope with her In any case had their love affair, been discovered in Zanzibar Princess Talma would probably have faced death, and the German would have been expelled from the islands, , Tt the same time Princess Talmas writing reflect the prejudices and limitations inherent in her position as a member of the Arab ruling class in a slave society these attitudes may explain her negative sentiments regarding Africans, Zanzibar in the middle of the nineteenth century was an Arab feudal Sultanate, reigning over a commercial and plantation empire inhabited largely by Africans, whose dominant culture was Swahili The island of Zanzibar became a province, of Man following the outer of the Portuguese around 1700 and in 1840 Sultan Seyyid Said Princess Talmas father decided to move his capital to Zanzibar, In the nineteenth century Zanzibar was at the center of European gunboat diplomacy and was eventually ceded to the British in 1890 The Arab sultanate, nonetheless remained in place i in some form until the month after Zanzibars, independence in 1963 when it was overthrown by a violent revolution and Zanzibar united with Tanganyika to form Tanzania Of late there has been a revival of, interest in the Arab period currently a whole room in Zanzibars Palace Museum, is devoted to Princess Saline, , , MMMulokozi]  [, , , , Is long as the child does not have though strength to wear scandals the, wooden ones for girls and women are called Udo the leather ones for boys, andmen are called wage it runs about barefooted Because the water are considerably lighter to wear than the ubk verysmall girls initially are made to, walk on the former until they have acquired the necessary skill to wear the, kubkb forever Either children nor adults of both sexes wear stockings only, more aristocratic ladies use them now and then when riding as custom requires, one to cover the ankles, , Already at the age of two to four months two or three slaves besides the wet, nurses were allotted to the child by our father From then on they remained its, property The older it grew the more slaves it received for its personal attendance Of one of them died our father replaced him or gave an appropriate sum, of money Up toa certain age little girls wear boys caps in the house, , Until his seventh year each prince at home stays among the women It this, age the mosaic rite circumcision is performed on him Ceremonies of course, play an important role on this occasion the closing of which after the childs, recovery forms a peculiar festivity in which all dignitaries and high officials are, allowed to take part His deed if in any way possible was enacted in the country and in the presence of our father A public entertainment usually lasting for, three days also accompanied this, , A RoyAL CHILDHOOD of ZANZIBAR  81, , , From this time onwards every boy received a quiet mare of his own His, escort could take their mount from the stables where a couple of hundred, Arabian horses were standing In this way the boy at a very early age learns to, ride well and acquires a very outstanding skill and nimbleness which only a, trained circus rider is otherwise created with Since we had neither a true saddle nor stirrup it required of course much more dexterity to gain a firm seat, than in this country Our father followed a characteristic custom when his sons, ran into some misha while out riding In that case not only they themselves, but also their escort could expect punishment For our father assumed that the, latter with the tight warrants and instructions which he had conferred on, them must have behaved much too indulgently towards the princes, , Not one of us was spoiled in any way By fathers high sense of justice and, unparalleled generosity was combined with an equally firm consistency which, did not know any weakness All of us had to obey our teachers and educators on, the strength of their word be they Grabs Abyssinians or simple negroes Of, occasionally we complained to our father we certainly left his presence in tears, or shame for our behaviour His severity taught us the reverence due to such, people and with increasing age the appreciation of how deep our moral indebtedness to them was also grew, , The nurses even if they had served as such for a very short time were particularly honoured and enjoyed special esteem for the remainder of their life By, birth they were always slaves but as a rule they were freed in reward of their, fidelity and devotion The black wet nurses especially distinguished themselves, by extraordinary fidelity and attachment Even the most cautious mother might, in all confidence leave her child with the wet nurse who usually considered herself as its second mother and acted accordingly Now the lack of interest and the, heartlessness of the wet nurses in these parts stand out in stark contrast with, this Often enough have I felt myself forced to give on a public halfway a good, talking to such a character totally unknown to me for her brutal treatment of, the little thing entrusted to her His contrast between the wet nurses of these, parts and our Arab ones may possibly be explained by the fact that the former, are forced by their poverty alone to entrust their own beloved child to complete, strangers under much sacrifice Only for moneys sake they serve masters, whether the child to nurse is called Tom or Sick is indifferent to them their, thoughts and feelings naturally linger with their own child And which mother, would hold this against her, , Now very different is a black nurses attitude towards her mistresss child, entrusted to her For years she is in the latters service she may even have been, born in her house it then is understandable that she does not have many private, interests that she makes those of her masters her own Moreover there is the, most important fact that a black wet nurse only very rarely if ever is required to, part with her child but may quietly retain it The wet nurses child then receives, the same nourishment as its little master or mistress the same milk soup part, of the same fowl etc the same goes for the bath and the used dresses fall no, , 82  THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES, less to its lot When its mother stops serving as a wet nurse her child continues, to be the playmate of her second fosterchild Though remaining a slave it is, always preferred to the rest of the slaves and only bad people offend against, this attachment to the fosterbrother, , The black wet nurses however have one very bad habit They know how to, tell the little children of three to five years old very dreadful stories and fairytales Partly to amuse them partly also to keep them quiet The lion limb the, leopard but the elephant endo and the numerous witches watchawt, occupy of course the first place in these often also for adults terrifying tables, , In the whole rearing a child in the south is unquestionably much easier, than here in the north above all the everlasting cold and everything they usually entail are rare Notwithstanding all indolence children there are very independent and adroit for they are allowed to play and jump freer and more, constrained both in space and in dress to their hearts content Though, gymnastics exercises are completely unknown it is no rarity that a boy of ten to, twelve in playing takes a stiff run and leaps over one or even two horses High, jumping in general plays an important role and everybody strikes as much as he, can to surplus the other, , Swimming in the sea was practised no less eagerly and everybody taught, himself without any guidance Shooting too began early and was pursued with, great passion Lockfights were extraordinarily favoured from youth onward, many an hour was devoted to them Though the boys went about armed to the, teeth and carried as much powder and lead as grownup one hardly ever heard, of an accident caused by imprudence, , Up torn certain age only the young princes as already mentioned above lived, in their fathers house When a house of their own was assigned to each to keep,

Mkubwa was the ruler of the citystate of Ilya, Island off the coast of presentday Tanzania Little is known about her life or her, reign other than that her father and her brother ruled before her and her brothers, son succeeded her The may have become the ruler of Ilya as the eldest surviving child of Sultan Muhammad Mkubwa or she may have been serving as a, regent for her brothers son until he was old enough to assume leadership of the, sultanate In some other citystates rule was passed from mother to daughter In, the early 1800s for example Queen Mwanzuani succeeded her mother as ruler of, Pua on Mania Island and in the late 1800s Sabani into Gums the ruler of, Mikindani was succeeded by her daughter, Scholars have document twentysix women rulers of the citystates along, thesEast African coast during the seventeenth eighteenthand nineteenth centuries and there may well have been more since the historical record in this area, remains incomplete The names of earlier women rulers became praise names for, individual citystates and these praise names were used in poetry to comment on, the communities and their inhabitants For example as explained by Ashamed, H Abdulaziz in his book Muyaka NineteenthCentury Swahili Popular Poetry the, Mombasa poet Muyaka bin Nasi referred to Mombasa as Gongwa of Want, Kiss Gongwa is an earlier name for Mombasa and Want Kiss is the, name of the legendary female ruler of Mombasa Similarly Muyaka referred to, the people of Zanzibar as the descendants of Want Eliza after the islands, legendary female ruler Abdulaziz also finds references in poetry to Want Size, of Same Want Musura of Late and Want Shamba Whale of Gumma, In 1711 Sultan Intima composed a letter to Mwinyi Human whose father, seems to have been from Mombasa The ascribe whose name is not legible in the, manuscript wrote the letter in Swahili in Arabic script Both Swahili and Arabic, were used by the elite of the Swahili citystates during this period and it is likely, that Sultan Intima was literate in both languages While Arabic was used for, communication with Man officials and merchants and was also used along, with Portuguese for communication with Portuguese officials and merchants it, appears that Swahili written in Arabic script may often have been used for communications between Swahili citystates Messengers who traveled by how, transmitted letters from one citystate to another, It the time Sultan Intima wrote her letter Portuguese control of the Last, African coast was waning and Man Arab dominance of the regionwas being, established In the letter Sultan Intima seems to indicate that she has established, an alliance with or accepted the protection of the ruler of Man Presumably, Portuguese officials intercepted the messenger confiscated the letter before it, reached Mwinyi Human and had it translated into Portuguese in their Boa headquarters by Want Day in alSayyid Mbwana Shake who identified himself in, his translation as a prince of Papa Island Papa Island is located off the northern, coast of Sonya and was another Swahili citystate, Inn Biersteker]

      "2  [Emily Quite also known as, Princess Talma of Zanzibar, a A ROYAL CHILDHOOD of ZANZIBAR, Tanzania 1886 German]  [D a a of i G, so  It  am, 2 oeewies  to Is 2 He, oe  2, a tafa, His extract is taken from the autobiography of Princess Talma sometimes spelled, Same Said later known as Emily Quite Princess Talma was born in 1844, according to her own statements or 1840 according to other sources in the house, of Seyyid Said who was Sultan of Man and Zanzibar from 1804 to 1856, Princess Talma was one of Seyyid Saids more than thirty children The grew up in, her fathers various palaces until she was about sixteen After her fathers death she, elope with a German businessman Enrich Quite went to live in Germany and, converted to Christianity adopting the name Emily Quite Her husband died in, an accident a few years later leaving her with three small children The lived and, raised her children on her own with very meager resources Her attempts to, recover the inheritance she would have been due as a member of the royal family, of Zanzibar were not successful The died in 1924 and was buried in Hamburg, Princess Talmas autobiography Memoiren line arabischen Prinzessin was completed in 1886 and first published in Germany in 1888 It was soon followed by, an English translation In her preface the author says she wrote the book for her, children since she feared she might not live long enough to tell them her story, when they grew upa concern that turned out to be unfounded, Princess Talmas is the first full length autobiography written by a Tanzanian, It provides a unique insiders glimpse of life in Zanzibar and especially in the, royal palaces in the middle of the nineteenth century Even more remarkable is, the fact that the story is told from a womans perspective casting light on the, rights duties and predicament of upperclass women in the midst of incessant, palace intrigue the relations between Arab rulers and African servants in the, palace and the general court culture and manners Princess Talmas deduction of, her life in German culture as a lonely ArabAfrican widow in an alienand, coldland makes sad and engaging reading In her memoir as a whole she, emerges as a courageous and singleminded rebel and provides what is probably, the first record of a Tanzanian woman of herstature denying the strict social, forms of her time place and position, In the Zanzibar of Princess Talmas time it was quite unthinkable for, an upperclass Slim woman to marry a nonSlim let alone a foreigner, 80  THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES, Upperclass women in Zanzibar were usually secluded from the prying eyes of all, males other than their very close relatives They were required to hide themselves, whenever visitors entered the house and to be fully shrouded and escorted by, armed eunuchs and servant women whenever they went out It is thus difficult to, know how the young German businessman managed even to meet Talma let, alone come to an agreement to elope with her In any case had their love affair, been discovered in Zanzibar Princess Talma would probably have faced death, and the German would have been expelled from the islands, Tt the same time Princess Talmas writing reflect the prejudices and limitations inherent in her position as a member of the Arab ruling class in a slave society these attitudes may explain her negative sentiments regarding Africans, Zanzibar in the middle of the nineteenth century was an Arab feudal Sultanate, reigning over a commercial and plantation empire inhabited largely by Africans, whose dominant culture was Swahili The island of Zanzibar became a province, of Man following the outer of the Portuguese around 1700 and in 1840 Sultan Seyyid Said Princess Talmas father decided to move his capital to Zanzibar, In the nineteenth century Zanzibar was at the center of European gunboat diplomacy and was eventually ceded to the British in 1890 The Arab sultanate, nonetheless remained in place i in some form until the month after Zanzibars, independence in 1963 when it was overthrown by a violent revolution and Zanzibar united with Tanganyika to form Tanzania Of late there has been a revival of, interest in the Arab period currently a whole room in Zanzibars Palace Museum, is devoted to Princess Saline, , MMMulokozi]  [, , , , Is long as the child does not have though strength to wear scandals the, wooden ones for girls and women are called Udo the leather ones for boys, andmen are called wage it runs about barefooted Because the water are considerably lighter to wear than the ubk verysmall girls initially are made to, walk on the former until they have acquired the necessary skill to wear the, kubkb forever Either children nor adults of both sexes wear stockings only, more aristocratic ladies use them now and then when riding as custom requires, one to cover the ankles, , Already at the age of two to four months two or three slaves besides the wet, nurses were allotted to the child by our father From then on they remained its, property The older it grew the more slaves it received for its personal attendance Of one of them died our father replaced him or gave an appropriate sum, of money Up toa certain age little girls wear boys caps in the house, , Until his seventh year each prince at home stays among the women It this, age the mosaic rite circumcision is performed on him Ceremonies of course, play an important role on this occasion the closing of which after the childs, recovery forms a peculiar festivity in which all dignitaries and high officials are, allowed to take part His deed if in any way possible was enacted in the country and in the presence of our father A public entertainment usually lasting for, three days also accompanied this, , A RoyAL CHILDHOOD of ZANZIBAR  81, , , From this time onwards every boy received a quiet mare of his own His, escort could take their mount from the stables where a couple of hundred, Arabian horses were standing In this way the boy at a very early age learns to, ride well and acquires a very outstanding skill and nimbleness which only a, trained circus rider is otherwise created with Since we had neither a true saddle nor stirrup it required of course much more dexterity to gain a firm seat, than in this country Our father followed a characteristic custom when his sons, ran into some misha while out riding In that case not only they themselves, but also their escort could expect punishment For our father assumed that the, latter with the tight warrants and instructions which he had conferred on, them must have behaved much too indulgently towards the princes, , Not one of us was spoiled in any way By fathers high sense of justice and, unparalleled generosity was combined with an equally firm consistency which, did not know any weakness All of us had to obey our teachers and educators on, the strength of their word be they Grabs Abyssinians or simple negroes Of, occasionally we complained to our father we certainly left his presence in tears, or shame for our behaviour His severity taught us the reverence due to such, people and with increasing age the appreciation of how deep our moral indebtedness to them was also grew, , The nurses even if they had served as such for a very short time were particularly honoured and enjoyed special esteem for the remainder of their life By, birth they were always slaves but as a rule they were freed in reward of their, fidelity and devotion The black wet nurses especially distinguished themselves, by extraordinary fidelity and attachment Even the most cautious mother might, in all confidence leave her child with the wet nurse who usually considered herself as its second mother and acted accordingly Now the lack of interest and the, heartlessness of the wet nurses in these parts stand out in stark contrast with, this Often enough have I felt myself forced to give on a public halfway a good, talking to such a character totally unknown to me for her brutal treatment of, the little thing entrusted to her His contrast between the wet nurses of these, parts and our Arab ones may possibly be explained by the fact that the former, are forced by their poverty alone to entrust their own beloved child to complete, strangers under much sacrifice Only for moneys sake they serve masters, whether the child to nurse is called Tom or Sick is indifferent to them their, thoughts and feelings naturally linger with their own child And which mother, would hold this against her, , Now very different is a black nurses attitude towards her mistresss child, entrusted to her For years she is in the latters service she may even have been, born in her house it then is understandable that she does not have many private, interests that she makes those of her masters her own Moreover there is the, most important fact that a black wet nurse only very rarely if ever is required to, part with her child but may quietly retain it The wet nurses child then receives, the same nourishment as its little master or mistress the same milk soup part, of the same fowl etc the same goes for the bath and the used dresses fall no, , 82  THE EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURIES, less to its lot When its mother stops serving as a wet nurse her child continues, to be the playmate of her second fosterchild Though remaining a slave it is, always preferred to the rest of the slaves and only bad people offend against, this attachment to the fosterbrother, , The black wet nurses however have one very bad habit They know how to, tell the little children of three to five years old very dreadful stories and fairytales Partly to amuse them partly also to keep them quiet The lion limb the, leopard but the elephant endo and the numerous witches watchawt, occupy of course the first place in these often also for adults terrifying tables, , In the whole rearing a child in the south is unquestionably much easier, than here in the north above all the everlasting cold and everything they usually entail are rare Notwithstanding all indolence children there are very independent and adroit for they are allowed to play and jump freer and more, constrained both in space and in dress to their hearts content Though, gymnastics exercises are completely unknown it is no rarity that a boy of ten to, twelve in playing takes a stiff run and leaps over one or even two horses High, jumping in general plays an important role and everybody strikes as much as he, can to surplus the other, , Swimming in the sea was practised no less eagerly and everybody taught, himself without any guidance Shooting too began early and was pursued with, great passion Lockfights were extraordinarily favoured from youth onward, many an hour was devoted to them Though the boys went about armed to the, teeth and carried as much powder and lead as grownup one hardly ever heard, of an accident caused by imprudence, , Up torn certain age only the young princes as already mentioned above lived, in their fathers house When a house of their own was assigned to each to keep, independently as a rule with their mother if she was still alive Is maintenance, ...]\n",
