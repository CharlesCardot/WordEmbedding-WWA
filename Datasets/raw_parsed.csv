Little is known about her life or her\n', ""reign other than that her father and her brother ruled before her and her brother's\n"", 'son succeeded her. She may have become the ruler of Kilwa as the eldest surviving child of Sultan Muhammad Mkubwa, or she may have been serving as a\n', 'regent for her brother’s son until he was old enough to assume leadership of the\n', 'sultanate. In some other city-states, rule was passed from mother to daughtér: In\n', 'the early 1800s, for example, Queen Mwanzuani succeeded her mother as ruler of\n', 'Kua on Mafia Island, and in the late 1800s Sabani binti Ngumi, the ruler of\n', 'Mikindani, was succeeded by her daughter.\n', '\n', 'Scholars have documented twenty-six women rulers of the city“states along\n', 'thesEast African coast during, the seventeenth, eighteenth,.and nineteenth centuries, and there may well have been more, since the historical record in this area\n', 'remains incomplete. The names of earlier women rulers became praise names for\n', 'individual city-states, and these praise names were used in poetry to comment on\n', 'the communities and their inhabitants. For example, as explained by Mohamed\n', 'H. Abdulaziz in his book Muyaka: Nineteenth-Century Swahili Popular Poetry, the\n', 'Mombasa poet Muyaka bin Haji referred to Mombasa as “Gongwa of Mwana\n', 'Mkisi.” “Gongwa” is an earlier name for Mombasa and “Mwana Mkisi” is the\n', 'name of the legendary female ruler of Mombasa. Similarly, Muyaka referred to\n', 'the people of Zanzibar as “the descendants of Mwana Aziza” after the island’s\n', 'legendary female ruler.

While Arabic was used for\n', 'communication with Omani officials and merchants and was also used, along\n', 'with Portuguese, for communication with Portuguese officials and merchants, it\n', 'appears that Swahili written in Arabic script may often have been used for communications between Swahili city-states.

In the letter, Sultan Fatima seems to indicate that she has established\n', 'an alliance with or accepted the protection of the ruler of Oman. Presumably,\n', 'Portuguese officials intercepted the messenger, confiscated the letter before it\n', 'reached Mwinyi Jumaa, and had it translated into Portuguese in their Goa headquarters by Bwana Ndau ibn al-Sayyid Mbwana Shaka, who identifies himself in\n', 'his translation as a prince of Faza Island.

If\n', 'occasionally we complained to our father, we certainly left his presence in tears\n', 'or shame for our behaviour. This severity taught us the reverence due to such\n', 'people, and with increasing age the appreciation of how deep our moral indebtedness to them was also grew.\n', '\n', 'The nurses, even if they had served as such for a very short time, were particularly honoured and enjoyed special esteem for the remainder of their life.

This contrast between the wet nurses of these\n', 'parts and our Arab ones may possibly be explained by the fact that the former\n', 'are forced by their poverty alone to entrust their own beloved child to complete\n', 'strangers under much sacrifice. Only for money’s sake they serve masters;\n', 'whether the child to nurse is called Tom or Dick is indifferent to them; their\n', 'thoughts and feelings naturally linger with their own child.

For years she is in the latter's service, she may even have been\n"", 'born in her house; it then is understandable that she does not have many private\n', 'interests, that she makes those of her masters her own. Moreover, there is the\n', 'most important fact that a black wet nurse only very rarely, if ever, is required to\n', 'part with her child, but may quietly retain it.

Shooting too began early and was pursued with\n', 'great passion. Mock-fights were extraordinarily favoured; from youth onward\n', 'many an hour was devoted to them. Though the boys went about armed to the\n', 'teeth and carried as much powder and lead as grown-ups, one hardly ever heard\n', 'of an accident caused by imprudence.\n', '\n', 'Up tora certain age only, the young princes, as already mentioned above, lived\n', 'in their father’s house.

Only when our father’s\n', 'ships arrived annually with the new purchases, did all my brothers and sisters\n', 'living outside the paternal house come with their families to receive each the\n', 'share belonging to him, whether he needed it or not. If any one of them had the\n', 'great misfortune of spending more than what his allowance brought in, it was\n', 'never made easy for him to pay his debts; nothing was more hateful to our\n', 'father, and the one who had brought this disgrace to himself was very much on\n', 'his guard not to incur the same a second time.\n', '\n', 'If a war broke out, as unfortunately was so often the case in Oman, all the\n', 'Princes, the half-grown included, had to take the field too and to take part in\n', 'the fight like any common man. On the whole, discipline was strict, but it only\n', 'raised the respect and reverence of the sons for their father. As a child I often\n', 'saw with astonishment how my elder brother, anticipating the slaves, hurried to\n', 'put. in readiness the sandals my father had Jeft at the door of his room.

The only thing\n', ""deserving mention at a princess's birth is that, in accordance with the hairdress\n"", 'in our country, a broad comb, generally of silver, is placed under the back of the\n', 'newborn to give it a flat shape for later age. When a Princess is married to one\n', 'of her cousins, who to be sure are more numerous in Oman than in Zanzibar,\n', 'she of course leaves the paternal house in exchange for that of her husband. The\n', 'former, however, the sole and real bulwark against all hardships of life, remains\n', 'always open as a place to live. But if she prefers, she can also go and live with a\n', 'brother. Every sister has her favourite brother, and vice versa;‘in joy and sorrow\n', 'these two stick together and support each other by word and deed. As praiseworthy and, for those concerned, as much a blessing as this habit was in such a\n', 'numerous family circle as ours, it understandably created many jealousies\n', 'among brothers and sisters, and it often required a strong character to overcome\n', 'all these.\n', '\n', 'Often such a loving sister had to intercede with our father for some imprudence of her favourite brother, for he liked to favour his daughters and rarely\n', 'left their requests unheard. To his elder daughters in particular he was extraordinarily obliging; he usually went to meet them from afar and had them seated\n', 'by his side on the sofa, while the grown-up sons and we little people stood\n', 'respectfully before him.\n', '\n', 'Schooling (mdarse) is of very little importance for the Oriental in general\n', 'and consequently for us too.

Then, for want of any other school-book, we started\n', 'reading the Kuran with which, as mentioned above, writing lessons were connected for the boys. When one was able to read a little, one joined the others\n', 'who all read in a chorus and mostly very loudly. But that was all, for what is\n', 'read and learned is never explained. Hence there was at most only one among\n', 'thousands who understood word by word all the meanings and precepts of-the\n', 'Holy Script of the Muslims and who was able to explain them, though probably-eighty out of one hundred had learned half of it by heart. Reflecting upon\n', 'the Holy Script was even considered irreligious and unauthorized; people\n', 'should simply believe what they were taught, and this maxim was rigorously\n', 'carried out.\n', '\n', ""Having enjoyed some fruit, we had to assemble at seven o'clock in the morning on our mat, which had been rolled up during the night and was now swept\n"", 'clean, and had to await the arrival of our severe lady teacher. Until she arrived,\n', 'we whiled away the time to our heart’s content with wrestling, boxing, jumping,\n', 'climbing the railings which was life endangering, and other favourite amusements of the children’s world. We set a watch at the bend of the gallery, who by\n', 'simulated coughing announced the teacher’s arrival from afar. In no time we\n', 'were all sitting on the mat, an image of the greatest innocence, and only when\n', 'her steps came near, did we rebound like India rubber balls, to shake hands\n', 'respectfully with the dreaded one and to wish her good morning. She always\n', 'carried the detested bamboo cane in one hand and a large brass inkstand in the\n', 'other. We stood in file before her until she had taken her seat; only then were\n', 'we permitted to follow this example. All of us sat cross-legged on the mat,\n', 'flocked together in a circle around the teacher.\n', '\n', ""She now would begin to recite the first sura of the Kuran, the Muslim Lord's\n"", 'prayer as it were. We prayed in chorus after her and concluded with the wellknown Amin (not Amen). Then we repeated what we had learned the day\n', 'before, and after that we were given a new piece for reading or writing. Lessons\n', 'tegularly lasted until about nine o’clock, and then, after breakfast, again till\n', 'about noon, the time of the second prayer.\n', '\n', 'Each of us was allowed to bring some of his slaves to school to take part in\n', 'the lessons; they sat at some distance behind us, while we grouped ourselves as\n', 'we pleased, for there were neither fixed places for us or division in different\n', 'forms. People had not the faintest notion of school reports, which a few times\n', 'every year occasion feverish excitement in this country. If someone made particularly good or bad progress, distinguished himself particularly through good\n', 'or bad behaviour, this usually was reported orally to the respective mothers and\n', 'to our father.

Her downfall came though failure to observe social limits.

This was\n', 'a breach of taboo that society could not tolerate, and she had to resign from\n', 'office. The circumstances are ambiguous, since her mentor, District Chief Karuri\n', 'wa Gakure, was also defying tradition by dancing with younger men. Wangu\n', 'nonetheless continued to be greatly respected until her death in 1936. Her son,\n', 'Jacob Muchiri, occupied her old post as headman of Weithaga Location from\n', '1915 to 1936.

If not engaged in the fields, the women\n', 'may be seen busily employed at home, pounding maize in a large wooden mortar or grinding the corn on a smooth slab of stone, by means of a smaller stone\n', 'which they work to and fro with their hands.

Both Kitandi and Mapesa advanced quickly and were admitted to the\n', 'catechumen’s class, and Kitandi, always the leader, became a pupil teacher.\n', 'Early in the days of the great war, I had seven of these bigger girls helping to\n', 'teach besides the two Baganda women who had answered my appeal for help\n', 'from the center.\n', '\n', 'As thousands of Kavirondo boys were month by month drafted to the war, a\n', 'few as recruits in the army but most of them as carriers, and after my brother\n', 'had followed them down to “German East [Africa],” the girls, with fewer to\n', 'cook and work for at home, came in increasing numbers to learn; especially on\n', 'Sundays we often had more than three hundred in the girls Sunday-school\n', 'alone so that when the drum sounded for service I could only send the senior\n', 'class on to church with the adults and the boys, while with the juniors we cartied on a little service of our own, with a great deal of singing. These Bahanga,\n', 'unlike the Baganda, were naturally a very musical people and loved to sing in\n', 'parts. During this time of crowded school my friend Kitandi disappeared for a\n', 'fortnight, and I was told that her mother was very ill and Kitandi was nursing\n', 'her day and night, the two other daughters, heathen, leaving all the work to her.\n', 'Then one day they told me that the mother was dead and Kitandi dying. I had\n', 'seen her a few days before, tired but well: So immediately after school I called\n', 'my car-boys and set out to their hill where I found the heathen funeral customs\n', 'being carried on in even unusual wildness. Wailing was loud and continuous;\n', 'men would from time to time climb up the poles of the little grain stores and\n', 'fling themselves down yelling; one would rush into the cook-house, seize a\n', 'water pot or cooking-pot, and fling it into the midst of the circle in the courtyards, smashing it to atoms; another caught a fowl and wrung its neck; yet\n', ""another tore a cloth from a woman's back and tore it to shreds. All these hysterical doings supposed to propitiate the spirit of the departed as being done in her\n"", 'honour. My inquiries as to Kitandi only élicited, “She isn’t here.” At least I persuaded a young boy to guide me a quarter of an hout’s walk on a track over the\n', '\n', '104 ¢ ‘THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY (1900-1935)\n', '\n', 'hill to the house where she had been deposited. They told me that when the\n', 'mother died her relations started the wailing and called the girl to join in; she\n', 'refused and knelt down to pray in a corner. Again they called her to help wrap\n', 'up the body and found that, worn out with sorrow and watching, she had\n', 'fainted. Imagining that the spirit had struck her down because she refused to\n', 'wail, some of them lifted her up, carried her unconscious to the nearest Christian house, and flung her in the doorway saying, “Take your Christian.” She had\n', 'a severe illness after that, tended only by one little brother who would come to\n', 'fetch soup and medicine for her and by the Christian young man into whose\n', 'hut she had been so unceremoniously thrown.\n', '\n', 'After the war was over, when our boys, diminished in numbers, returned, I\n', 'soon became distinctly anxious over my pupil teachers, who came late instead\n', 'of punctually, dull instead: of cheery, shrugging their shoulders when asked to\n', 'put out the reading sheets or slates, cross or falling asleep in their classes. I\n', 'began to wonder whether we were to have an outbreak of sleeping sickness, and\n', 'whether the government doctor would come and examine them! Then one day\n', 'a man catechist came and asked me, “Do you think that it is wise what these\n', 'girls of yours‘are doing?” and I begged him to tell me what it was. So it came\n', 'out that the boys during the campaign had been much laughed at by the more\n', 'civilized coast boys both because their faces showed the old tribal marks, or\n', 'scars, of heathen days, and because most of them could not read. And on their\n', 'return they found that their sisters had got ahead of them. So as many of them\n', 'had acquired lamps or lanterns each held one of my pupil-teachers and made\n', 'them start night classes, fifteen or twenty youths to each lamp, and some of\n', 'these carried on up to 3.00 a.m., the lassitude of the girls thoroughly accounted\n', 'for. The help of the men catechists made some other arrangements, and the\n', 'girls were told only to teach by daylight in the kraals, say for an hour before\n', 'sunset. Kitandi, a few months later had got together a village gathering of sixty\n', 'under a big tree, some old women and little children who could not come so far\n', 'as Butere to learn.

They\n', 'must be patient, but they were anything but patient; after a few minutes debate\n', 'among themselves they turned to her again. “Then we will take you.”\n', '\n', 'But again she must refuse.

Eggs and. milk\n', 'were in plenty; big fish were available; and certain goods sold cheaply in shops.\n', 'But the most harrowing thing was the scarcity of that important commodity,\n', 'water. The water obtainable here was, more often than not, brackish, and if one\n', 'needed nice drinkable water, untainted with salt, one had to go into immeasurable difficulties to get it. So I asked some of the villagers, “Where can one get\n', 'nice water which is not brackish?” And they replied, “It is obtainable far from\n', 'here in a hole in the rocks. Would you like to go there and have a look?” I\n', 'repliéd, “Yes I would.” So in the afternoon we paid a visit to the place. The road\n', 'leading to the place is bad, very rocky. One had to move slowly and carefully to\n', 'avoid hurting oneself from the sharp stones or by tripping over.\n', '\n', 'Also, one needed to wear-shoes. Without shoes it was impossible. We\n', 'walked for nearly an hour, and we finally arrived at the scene. We rested a while\n', 'before descending into the cave.\n', '\n', 'Surprisingly, lianas [woody vines] grow in abundance there, and they assisted\n', '\n', 'WARTIME IN ZANZIBAR + 141\n', 'people to make the descent into the cave. And the descent is quite treacherous,\n', 'sloping down 30 feet into the cave. At the mouth of the cave there are huge\n', 'trees, and the overhanging branches form a sort of canopy over the entrance. As\n', 'a result it is rather dark and very damp inside the cave, and if one remains inside\n', 'for long one tends to become short of breath. I think it is because there is a poor\n', 'circulation of air inside the cave, and sunlight does not freely penetrate through.\n', 'And it is for this reason, I think, that the cave is named The Shadow.\n', '\n', 'In the recesses of the cave there is a small inner cave.

But for savory\n', 'dishes the villagers use the brackish water from the wells in their vicinity. They\n', 'use this water also for washing and for other household needs. In Jambiani the\n', 'houses do not have corrugated iron roofs (as is the case in Chwaka) so it is not\n', ""possible to harvest rain water and preserve it'in tanks for emergency uses. So we\n"", 'can imagine the plight of the people resulting from the scarcity of water.\n', '\n', 'Fetching water is done exclusively by women. In fact, the women there have\n', 'numerous arduous tasks to perform, especially in the Hadim farmsteads. These\n', 'tasks include fetching water, cutting firewood, cultivating the fields, and\n', 'thrashing coconut husks. This in addition to the housework, the rearing of children, and other chores. In my view, cultivation is the most difficult of these\n', 'tasks, because the women have to walk a fairly long distance to the fields, where\n', 'they have to break the rocky soil in order to plant seeds. The crops which flourish in these areas are pigeon peas, maize, green gram, pumpkins, yams,\n', 'sorghum, bulrush millet, beans, and cow peas. When harvesting draws near the\n', 'peasant farmers and their families have to move from the village and set up\n', 'camp in the cultivated fields to guard their crops from forages of monkeys in\n', 'the day-time and wild pigs at night.\n', '\n', 'To conclude, I would ‘say that the women in Jambiani work harder than the\n', 'men.

That day, a man whose child they had\n', 'bought when they left Nkula told the Arabs, “I will show you the safe way to go\n', 'because the white people have forbidden the buying of slaves. Otherwise you\n', 'may pass near them and be caught.” This man then went on to say, “Remain here\n', 'drying meat, Let me go and spy because we are about to reach the white men’s\n', 'place.” He got up and went to the white people at Ikomba and informed them\n', 'that the Arabs had come with slaves bought in Bemba and Lungu country.\n', '\n', 'Upon hearing this, the white men were pleased and sent word to Kawa where\n', 'the white commander of the askaris (soldiers), Mr. Bell, lived.

Mr. Bell was very delighted and\n', 'the askaris began to take their positions.\n', '\n', 'We left and went past the road from Ikomba to Ikawa This same man told\n', 'the Arabs, “This is the road from Ikomba. Now that we have gone past this road\n', 'we are out of danger. We are heading for Mwenzo.” When the whites realized\n', 'we were near, they went to Chitete ahead of us to lay a trap. When the evening\n', 'came this man said, “Let me go and scout the way again.” He went and found\n', 'the whites and the askaris had reached Chitete. The man came back late in the\n', 'evening. We left. We reached the village and the Arabs decided that we would\n', 'pitch camp outside the village because it was crowded with people. One of the\n', 'Arabs went to the village gate, but no one told him his enemies were inside. The\n', 'villagers came to see us, and evert asked the Arabs if they were willing to buy\n', 'slaves. The Arabs agreed, not knowing that they were being deceived.\n', '\n', 'On that journey we had been divided into six groups. My group was in the\n', 'lead. We crossed a stream called Chitete and heard the signal to make camp.\n', 'We started to prepare shelters. We, the younger ones, carried branches of trees\n', 'cut by the elders. Our shelter was near an anthill. The Arabs had donkeys\n', 'which brayed every night, but not this particular one.\n', '\n', 'Early the next morning, the horn sounded, telling us to tie up our bundles.\n', 'The second horn was sounded, signifying departure time. One Arab took a\n', 'child from its mother, telling her to dress so that we could leave. After a short\n', 'while we heard gun shots. Everybody was scared and jumped and scattered into\n', 'the bush. What confusion! The Arab holding the child had nowhere to put it\n', 'and he kept jumping to and fro with it. 1 went to the ant-hill where I found a\n', 'little boy hidden. He said, “Hide your head in the elephant grass. Get down.\n', ""Don't let them see us.” As I was stopping, another child joined us.\n"", '\n', 'Then gunfire shattered the silence. The shooting was continuous. Armed\n', 'men were running towards the ant-hill where we were. We thought perhaps\n', 'they had spotted us. We were already running when we saw that the child had\n', 'been shot in one leg and was crying out in pain. A woman too had been shot in\n', 'the back. She asked for help. In response I showed her my leg where nkololwe (a\n', 'thorny plant) had scratched me and blood was oozing. I lied and answered,\n', '“Look, I have also been shot.” Then I ran away to an ant-hill with the two little\n', 'boys following me. The gunfire ceased and all was quiet. We whispered to each\n', 'other saying, “Perhaps they have now gone.” There were a few more shots.\n', 'When one of the boys climbed to the top of an ant-hill to spy he saw no one.\n', 'Then everything became silent.\n', '\n', 'Because we had been running to and fro, we lost our sense of direction.\n', 'When we asked one another where we had come from, one of us suggested that\n', 'we should surrender ourselves to the people firing guns because otherwise we\n', '\n', 'FROM SLAVERY TO FREEDOM ¢ 175\n', '\n', 'would be lost. I did not know where the Arabs and the rest of the people had\n', 'gone. When the sun was over our heads, we began to feel very hungry. We forgot all about the soldiers and were concerned only about what we might eat.\n', 'When we looked about, we saw only trees and because we were all children, we\n', 'invoked our fathers, “What shall we do?” We asked each other, “Have you been\n', 'shot?” The other boy said, “No.” I said, “I was only scratched by a thorn.” One\n', 'of my companions said, “When I was coming here I found they had killed an\n', 'Arab’s wife.” At that point, I told my friends “Let us find a place to go, or are we\n', 'going to spend the night here?” We then left the ant-hill, moving furtively.\n', '\n', 'After a short while we then heard the drums summoning the soldiers back to\n', 'their camp. The sound of drums came from where we had camped. We followed the sound which stopped after a short time. We found a small path and\n', 'hoped it would lead us to the place. It only led us into gardens. Since we were\n', 'so hungry we plucked and ate the millet like goats. We went on into a field of\n', 'sorghum and ate that too. One boy noticed peanuts and called us to that place.\n', 'We ran there and began eating. Thirst also overcame us. When we were full we\n', 'followed a path and after going a little distance found soldiers’ tracks and then\n', 'a village where people were sitting on an ant-hill. They saw us and said, “Look,\n', 'there are some children coming.” When we got near we realized that they were\n', 'in fact the people on the white man’s side. An order had been made forbidding\n', 'any person to leave the village: that is why they were standing, keeping watch\n', 'on the ant-hills. They came and led us to where the whites were.\n', '\n', 'The White Men Send Us to Kawimbe\n', 'Thereafter, they took us into the village. I noticed that the donkey used by the\n', 'Arabs was tied to a stake: its foreleg was broken. They gave us food. Early next\n', 'day they took us to Ikomba.

When I looked around, I saw my uncle Kapempe\n', 'and the sister-in-law of Museo who was the grandmother of David Namwezi,\n', 'and many other relatives of mine. When I first saw them, I thought that they\n', 'were other people whom I had just mistaken for my relatives because our home\n', 'was far away and there was no reason for them‘to come here.\n', '\n', 'One day I went out and as I was leaving the white man’s gate, I met\n', 'Chinyanje. She looked at me closely and asked, “Young girl, who are you?” I\n', 'answered, “I am Mwenya.” She then replied, “Mwenya the daughter of\n', 'Mumemba>” I agreed.

Is she likely to\n', 'reappear now? No, you have only seen some other person who resembles her.”\n', 'But she insisted, “No! It must be she.

Chinyanje\n', 'said to my uncle, “Here she comes!” When I arrived where they were, they\n', 'embraced me and began to cry. My uncle also cried and before long we were all\n', 'crying. The next morning they sent word to Chief Changala in Bembaland.\n', '\n', 'They sent for my elder sister, the mother of Mulenga Chisani, to come and\n', '\n', 'identify me conclusively.

He told\n', 'them that, if they found that it was truly I, they should tell the white men to\n', 'allow me to return with them to Bembaland.\n', '\n', 'Indeed they found I was the one. They asked the white men for permission\n', 'from them to take me. The whites said, “This person was brought to us. We\n', 'therefore cannot let you take her. If you really recognize her as one of your family, go and tell Chief Changala himself to come and bring a cow with him to\n', 'redeem her.” My brothers were very sad to hear that they refused to let me go.\n', 'They then went back and told Chief Changala who said, “Oh dear, what a difficult condition. Where shall we find a cow? In Bembaland too the situation is\n', 'the same. There are no cows!”\n', '\n', 'After a long time the Chief sent my brothers to the white men with the message that as he had no cow with which to redeem the child, would they not just\n', ""let the girl go without seeking payment? The Chief had continued, “Other people are identifying and freely taking their relatives, why shouldn't I?” The whites\n"", 'said, “True enough you have identified your relative, but you may not take her\n', 'now because she is very hard-working in the house and at school. Perhaps the\n', 'best you can do is to come and visit her here occasionally and when she marries\n', 'she will then come to your home with her husband.” They agreed. One of them\n', 'decided to remain at Kawimbe saying, “I will stay and keep an eye on this\n', 'child.” He stayed a year but because he was used to cifemene as opposed to digging the soil, he gave up and went back to Bembaland. Despite his absence\n', 'Kawimbe village was still crowded with my relatives.\n', '\n', 'I Become Engaged\n', '\n', 'When my brother returned to Bembaland, I remained with the whites, doing\n', 'domestic work and learning in school. In 1900 Bwana Purvis went to\n', 'Mbereshi, leaving me in the care of Mama May. He went to Mbereshi with a\n', 'young carpenter called Jones Changolo, the son of Mutota Simusokwe. In 1901\n', 'he sent word to Bwana Govan Robertson to say that he intended to become\n', 'engaged to me and sent a nsalamu (token payment to indicate interest in marrying a girl). Bwana Robertson called the elders and asked them how engagement ceremonies are conducted under Mambwe custom. The elders then told\n', 'him how it was done.

He is the nephew of Chileya\n', 'Sichikandawa.” The whites said, “Well, we shall hear what his uncle has to say\n', 'because the girl has already agreed.” They then called and asked him.

She would learn\n', '\n', '178 + THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY (1936-1969)\n', '\n', 'when she grew older. He further said, “I do not like small women.

The white men then asked, “What do you pay in order to seal an\n', 'engagement, nsambo (bracelets) or beads?” They answered, “If the girl agrees\n', 'and the father has given his blessing, one also pays icumalui (a token payment to\n', 'request admission to the girl’s home, literally meaning a knocking fee), a hoe\n', 'striped with lines drawn out of white lime. After all these tokens are accepted\n', 'the boy makes nsambo (bangles) for the girl to wear on her legs. Finally, a\n', 'bridewealth of ten sheep (an installment) is paid.”\n', '\n', 'The whites, upon hearing all this, sent word to Jones saying that the girl had\n', 'agreed and the elders had explained the traditional things to be carried out and\n', 'the dowry that he would deliver. He should therefore come back in the month\n', 'that the rain finishes. When he came, Chileya discouraged him and said, “The\n', 'girl you want is not a good one. Many people do not like her because she is\n', 'hopelessly lazy. She does not know how to prepare msima, she is a useless woman.\n', 'We want you to become engaged to Nele who is hard-working.” But Jones\n', 'Changolo, whose other name was Silanda, refused. The elders also discouraged\n', 'him and said, “If you want a girl that is big in size you can choose Mpatame.”\n', 'Nevertheless, he objected strongly. They then said, “Well, you go ahead and\n', 'marry her on your own but we do not like her.” He replied, “Yes, that is all right,\n', 'she is the one I want.” These words were exchanged in the evening of the day he\n', 'arrived from Mbereshi. His father, Mufota, did not know anything about all this.\n', 'That same evening the whites, having heard that Jones had come, summoned\n', 'Chileya and his relatives and asked them, “The young man has come. What is\n', 'your stand? We want to hear from you in his presence.” Silanda told the boy they\n', 'serit, “Go and tell the whites that I shall come early tomorrow.” The whites came\n', 'and told me, “Your fiance will come early tomorrow, so wash your body well and\n', 'dress properly.” As I was dressing, Mama May came to see how I was doing and\n', 'she gave me some oil to rub on my body. After a short while we saw the young\n', 'man had arrived holding a lovely walking stick in his hand. He was very handsome. He waited outside. As she turned her head, Mama May saw him standing\n', 'there. She ran to me and said, “Meli, hurry up! Your fiance is here.” I went and\n', 'greeted him and all my friends too greeted him. They whispered to each other\n', 'saying, “What a tall handsome man, so dark—as dark as /ufungo (a dark plumlike\n', 'wild fruit).” Mama May led us into the house and called Robertson. They asked\n', 'the young man if his intention to marry me was serious. He said, “Yes.” He went\n', 'home. The next day they came with icuma/ui and the ten sheep. He spent only\n', 'two weeks at home and then went back to his job.\n', '\n', 'The Wedding\n', '\n', 'In the year 1902 the whites sent word to my man asking him to come back to\n', 'wed me.

I want to\n', 'marry off my ‘daughter’ before I leave.” Silanda, not one to refuse, came at harvest time and the preparations got under way. Mama May told my Uncle\n', 'Kapempe and my father-in-law Chileya, “I do not want this wedding to be\n', 'organised by you. I shall do everything and I will not do it in a European way. I\n', 'shall not even insist on going to church at all. I want to learn the Mambwe customs. I shall do everything properly; I shall buy the oil, perfume, and flour to\n', 'anoint her during the wedding.” She did everything and bought all the things\n', 'required for any wedding. She even bought a black cloth. “But,” she said, “I will\n', 'not brew beer.”\n', '\n', 'The wedding day came. Mama May invited many people, men and women,\n', ""my relatives and my bridegroom's relatives. All came on the arranged day in the\n"", 'late afternoon when it was cooler.

They ululated (made a high trilling sound). Yes, there was great rejoicing. I was hidden away in a dark corner and covered with cloth. After some\n', 'time the women told Mama May, the bride’s “mother,” “Mother of the girl, why\n', 'don’t you come and take up the zsimba and let it be heard?” but she replied,\n', '“Fellow women, you must show me how.” They forced her and she joined in the\n', 'dance. When the people saw how she danced they went wild dancing. She got\n', 'them to stop ululating and it became quieter. They danced on.

Lubega also wants to ensure adequate support for Makerere, which is\n', 'lacking in well-trained teachers and other vital resources. “If another university is\n', 'opened prematurely, Makerere may become crippled,” she declares.\n', '\n', 'Based on this statement, it appears that Lubega has a sophisticated understanding of such things as finance and strategic planning (more sophisticated, one\n', 'suspects, than most of her male colleagues’). She argues against grand plans that\n', 'do not reflect factual realities, and warns her fellow parliamentarians not to\n', 'depend too much upon promises of financial support from Britain, which has evidently agreed to provide funding for the new university.\n', '\n', 'It is remarkable to note how many of Florence Lubega’s points still resonate in\n', 'Uganda today. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, free secondary education was still available to less than a quarter of the nation’s children, prorhpting\n', ""the govérnment to announce an ambitious scheme for Universal Secondary Education (USE). While Uganda's progress in meeting its earlier goal of Universal\n"", 'Primary Education (UPE) has been widely praised, critics of USE echo the concerns expressed-by Lubega nearly fifty years earlier: Its success will rely largely on\n', 'funds provided by Western donor nations, which not only may prove unreliable\n', 'but also come with strings attached. Already Ugandan institutions—including its\n', 'educational system—have seen a dramatic move toward privatization, in part to\n', 'meet growing demand, and in part to accommodate the structural adjustment\n', 'policies demanded by the West. The qualifications of university staff also remains\n', 'an issue in contemporary Uganda: The 1999 Mujaju Report shook up higher\n', 'education by taking the position that all lecturers at Makerere University must\n', 'have doctorates.\n', '\n', '192 + THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY (1936-1969)\n', '\n', 'Even the question of science education for women, so prevalent today, was on\n', 'Lubega’s agenda in 1958: “If we are to expect to have women doctors and women\n', 'science teachers,” she declares, “more science laboratories should be established in\n', 'girls’ schools.”\n', '\n', 'Florence Ebila and Austin Bukenya\n']","['\n', '\n', '\n', 'Mr. Speaker, listening to the honourable the Minister of Education and Labour\n', 'last Friday, putting before the House in the most able way the proposals in the\n', 'Report of the 1958 Working Party on Higher Education in East Africa, I could\n', 'not help thinking that there was no need for fear in going ahead fast with the\n', 'scheme, since the greatest obstacle has been removed; money was coming from\n', 'Britain and the Minister himself had said that the Makerere College was not\n', 'going to be interfered with in its development. We need more and more people\n', 'to receive higher education and here is the way being opened. But Sir, looking\n', 'at the report of the Working Party, and also at the White Paper on Higher\n', 'Education in East Africa, and then turning to the White Paper on Education\n', 'in Uganda 1958/59 by my own Government, I fail to see how the scheme could\n', 'be brought into operation very soon until we have made enough provision for\n', 'secondary education. And, although some territories have been able to do so, it\n', 'is obvious that they are not going to get enough graduate teachers to teach in\n', 'these schools. And so the scheme to improve higher education will not be a\n', 'success. Therefore, Sir, I feel that the Minister’s motion needs to be debated\n', 'thoroughly in this House before it is noted and endorsed.\n', '\n', 'The problems should be pointed out, the difficulties and the need for careful\n', 'thinking, careful timing, seriously emphasised. The proposal that there is need\n', 'for additional institutions of higher education in East Africa and that the\n', 'United Kingdom government is taking over the financing of these universities\n', 'could not be more appreciated. And the fact that the East African Governments, in proposing this scheme, were well aware of a number of difficult academic and financial problems, makes me feel confident that there will be careful planning in the development of higher education in East Africa.\n', '\n', 'Sir, if I repeat what the Minister has already explained, I hope he will forgive\n', 'me because I could not hear him clearly, because of sitting behind him. The\n', 'Minister said in his speech that the Royal Technical College will be converted\n', 'into a university in the next quinquennium and that will be in 1961. But he did\n', 'not satisfy us as to why there is need for that urgency. Such a scheme as this\n', 'requires a great deal of discussing by the public before implementing it. Great\n', 'care should be taken on the question of timing, since on this will depend the\n', 'future success of every university in East Africa, old and new, and of the standards of higher education.\n', '\n', 'I would have liked the Minister to have gone at length into considerable\n', 'details of the scheme; giving us at least a satisfactory picture of a steady flow of\n', 'students from Uganda alone, who will be going to Makerere College for the\n', '\n', 'DEBATE ON HIGHER EDUCATION ¢ 193\n', 'next few years, without Kenya coming into the picture, and also the financing\n', 'of Makerere and the other universities, so that we know how much Britain is\n', 'proposing to spend on each university in the next quinquennium. For although\n', 'we have been told by the Minister that the financing of these universities will\n', 'be taken over by the United Kingdom government, I still feel, Sir, even Britain\n', 'could be helped and advised not to take on “premature babies” too early.\n', '\n', 'Although she is responsible and is committed to the building up of universities in East Africa and elsewhere in the Commonwealth, by doing more hard\n', 'thinking on our part and not allowing political pressure to make us act in haste\n', 'unless we must, we could save Britain a great deal of worry for the discontent\n', 'among the Africans not only as regards higher education, but other things as\n', 'well, that seems to be prevailing in East Africa today.\n', '\n', 'It is known, and the Working Party commented on it, that there is something like a state of emergency in East Africa, arising from the lack of young\n', 'people with training needed to support a rapidly evolving society.\n', '\n', 'Now, one could say that here is a way of meeting that need, we are opening a\n', 'new university to help these young people to be trained. But I still think that\n', 'would be putting the “cart before the horse.” It is impossible to build up universities before we expand secondary education. In fact our present secondary education’standards cannot meet the requirements of two universities. If Makerere\n', 'were filled to net capacity then we could open up a new university. Sir, the\n', 'Working Party came to examine and advise on these proposals, they did not\n', 'propose the scheme themselves. They were invited to come and make recommendations on the White Papér which was issued jointly by the East African\n', 'Governments, and because of their great experience in the field of education\n', 'and their knowledge, they warned us against falling into traps as regards developing higher education in East Africa. They made it clear from the start that\n', 'secondary education and higher education are mutually beneficial and necessarily bound up together.\n', '\n', 'Sir, they warned us that, without an adequate flow of good students from\n', 'senior secondary schools, the colleges would suffer great handicaps and their\n', 'development would be delayed and that to flood our universities with students\n', 'of low qualifications would be a serious disservice to the communities at this\n', 'stage of their development and would be unduly expensive. University planning\n', 'should, therefore, be related to the progress of the scheme for the development\n', 'and multiplication of secondary schools in all the territories. ‘The introduction\n', 'of the sixth forms in increasing numbers should be thought of seriously as an\n', 'essential condition of full university development before we open up another\n', 'university in the near future. Also, Sir, we cannot hope for good secondary\n', 'schools which are to feed these universities, functioning without a staff of thoroughly well-trained teachers. .. .\n', '\n', 'Makerere is still having difficulty in recruiting its staff and it had 20 senior\n', 'staff vacancies last August, and I have been told there are even more vacancies\n', 'now. The staff are overworking at Makerere College and they have no time for\n', '\n', '194 + THE Mip-TWENTIETH CENTURY (1936-1969)\n', '\n', 'research. Now, I should like to know how many members of staff there are at\n', 'the Royal Technical College, and why those people do not get transferred to\n', 'Makerere College and to fill up these 20 vacancies, and some more, which I\n', 'hear they have got now. If they fill up that gap they will relieve the people at\n', 'Makerere from overworking, and leave them free to get on with their research.\n', '\n', '‘The Working Party also stressed the point that it is of vital importance that,\n', 'in spite of all the difficulties, every effort should be made to search the world\n', 'over for the ablest men and women to be lecturers in these universities. I should\n', 'like to know what the Royal Technical College has done about recruiting its\n', 'staff?\n', '\n', 'Sir, another point is the financial problem; although we have been told that\n', 'Britain is going to finance these universities, we have already heard what the\n', 'Financial Secretaries in all these territories have said, that they have run out of\n', 'money, and we know that the position is not to be recovered overnight. Their\n', 'revenues are too small in proportion to the country’s current needs. I do not\n', 'think Britain can give us every single cent to use in these universities. We\n', 'assume we will take part in the financing of these universities. I should like to\n', 'hear from the honourable the Minister of Education as to how the governments of East Africa are going to make their contributions when we have more\n', 'than one university. I should also like, with all due respect, to ask the East\n', 'African governments to follow the good example of the British Parliament; of\n', 'submitting, and well in advance, university programmes covering say five, six or\n', '‘seven years, and secondary school programmes, for the public to see, or for the\n', 'House to be able to discuss.\n', '\n', 'You may say that Britain has money to help her to make plans well ahead,\n', 'but I believe that, although we have limited funds, we can still give a fair picture\n', 'of what it will be like in the next five or six years if we start another university.\n', 'I should like therefore, Sir, to ask all the governments to draw up their university programmes stating how many students will be forthcoming during those\n', 'years, with either Higher School Certificate or School Certificate first grade\n', 'qualifications. How many of those will go to Makerere College and-how many\n', 'to the Royal Technical College and how many to the new university, if it is\n', 'started during the next quinquennium?\n', '\n', 'They should also show the senior secondary school development programmes. Although Kenya has already done so to some extent, we could still\n', 'have some more information on how they are going to get the teachers, and\n', 'graduate teachers, to teach in their new schools.\n', '\n', 'I feel the graduate teachers are the main obstacle. Sir, these two programmes\n', 'are. essential to the.steady development of our universities, and as responsible\n', 'governments we could not do without them. I want this point to be taken seriously by the Minister of Education and Labour, for these universities must be\n', 'judged, not according to the political power in each territory, but exactly judged\n', 'in relation to the supply of students of good quality if we expect our universities\n', 'to have success in international standing and to attract students even from\n', '\n', 'DEBATE ON HIGHER EDUCATION ¢ 195\n', 'outside East Africa. One college may have enough of such good students but\n', 'what about another? We must work in co-operation and have higher education\n', 'discussed together. Unless we do so it is likely that staff, time, energy and\n', 'money will be wasted. If another university is opened prematurely, Makerere\n', 'may become crippled.\n', '\n', 'Let us turn to Makerere College now. It is important to see that Makerere,\n', 'as the University College of East Africa—for it does not consider itself to\n', 'belong only to Uganda, since it draws students from all the territories—\n', 'emerges successfully from its special relationship with the University of London not later than 1966. We should not propose new schemes to interfere with\n', 'this work. Sir, if this timing is not given serious thought and careful consideration, very grave damage may be done to the cause of higher education in East\n', 'Africa and the success already achieved may be in danger of coming to an end.\n', '\n', 'Makerere should be allowed to admit students from all over East Africa in\n', 'the next quinquennium, then left to its own development towards academic\n', 'autonomy at the end of that quinquennium. This institution is now eleven years\n', 'old, but I am subject to correction here. I think it started in 1949 and, in the\n', 'same year, it started degree work and it has been doing wonderful work from\n', 'the reports we study; and I am sure that we could still ask for it to remain, in the\n', 'future, the co-ordinating university of East Africa. It has also been stated, and I\n', 'think it is correct, that it has 895 students from all over East Africa and is not\n', 'yet filled to its capacity. ...\n', '\n', 'Now, supposing we start at the beginning of the quinquennium, let us\n', 'assume that the Royal Technical College is allowed to start, as suggested in the\n', 'report of the Working Party, a Faculty of Arts and Science. Since‘I believe\n', 'Makerere College draws more students from Kenya than anywhere else into\n', 'these faculties, I should like the honourable the Minister of Education and\n', 'Labour to show us how we are going to fill up that gap. It must be realised that\n', 'the staff at Makerere are doing more work than they need, in order to coach\n', 'students in the preliminary year to get to Higher School’Certificate standard\n', 'for their degree work. They are anxious to stop this and this means that we have\n', 'to start Higher School Certificate courses in as many secondary schools as possible. Makerere College is also doing some other work and that is to improve\n', 'the English of the students in order to make it better for their work as degree\n', 'students. We hope that the honourable the Minister of Education and Labour\n', 'is going to note these very important points and give the lecturers at Makerere\n', 'time to do their proper work and research, without doing the sort of work that\n', 'should be done in secondary schools.\n', '\n', 'Now, let us look at the problem in Uganda alone of secondary education.\n', 'Secondary education in Uganda has to improve if Kenya and Tanganyika are\n', 'going to keep their own students. It has been often stated-that the best students\n', 'at Makerere College do not come from Uganda. Why? It has also been often\n', 'stated that the English of the students from Uganda is not as good as it should\n', 'be. This is another matter that the Minister could probably look into and see\n', '\n', '196 + THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY (1936-1969)\n', '\n', 'how it could be improved. In the White Paper on Education in Uganda on\n', 'page 9 it says: “Academic courses leading to School Certificate will continue to\n', 'be provided as at present in the senior secondary schools. It is an aim of policy\n', 'to transfer to the schools work at the higher school certificate level and to this\n', 'end three schools will start the two-year course for higher certificate in 1959, in\n', 'arts and science; while a further school will start in 1960. In the beginning these\n', 'courses must be partly experimental and it is felt desirable to review the early\n', 'results before expanding or increasing the courses at present contemplated. No\n', 'further expansion of Higher School Certificate work will therefore take place\n', 'for four years, at the end of which time the matter will:be reviewed in the light\n', 'of experience.” Now this is the statement, Sir, which I found contradictory to\n', 'the White Paper on Higher Education. We are faced with another university,\n', 'and it means, if we are to do Makerere justice, that we have to start Higher\n', 'School Certificate work straight away without even making experiments. But\n', 'how are we going to do it? Where will the teachers come from? That is the\n', 'question; Makerere should not feel that it has to depend on Kenya and Tanganyika students.\n', '\n', 'The White Paper on education in Uganda also says, Sir, that it must be\n', 'repeated, that from any one group of children, no more than one-fifth are likely\n', 'to be suitable for an academic course. As far as finance permits, therefore, the\n', 'Government will aim at providing places in academic course in senior secondary schools for a maximum of one-fifth of the children who complete the best\n', 'course; but our children fail a great deal because of their English, so we cannot\n', 'rely on one-fifth coming through straight away. The report also goes on to say\n', 'that to provide a good secondary education fully qualified specialist staff are\n', 'required, together with the specialist facilities such as science laboratories. That\n', 'is another point, Sir, I should like to look into. How many science laboratories\n', 'have we in our secondary schools and if we want more where will the money\n', 'come from? Makerere draws most of its students from Kenya and Tanganyika\n', 'for the Science Faculty, and if we have to get students from Uganda alone to\n', 'feed Makerere in the next quinquennium, how could that be done. And even if\n', 'we forget the next quinquennium, I still feel that something should be started\n', 'straight away on the lines of having good science laboratories in secondary\n', 'schools. Science teaching in most of our schools is very poor indeed, because\n', 'there are not enough teachers and not enough equipment, especially in girls’\n', 'schools. If we are to expect to have women doctors and women science teachers, more science laboratories should be established in girls’ schools.\n', '\n', '‘1 mentioned earlier on, Sir, the problem of English in our secondary schools\n', 'and that the Makerere staff was doing most of the work to improve the English\n', 'of the students before they start their degree work. The teaching of English\n', 'needs a great deal of improving in many schools in Uganda. Very often I meet\n', 'students who have failed to get into Makerere and many people will agree with\n', 'me that it is not because they are not intelligent enough, but because they had a\n', 'bad start learning English and they have not had good teachers to teach them\n', '\n', 'DEBATE ON HIGHER EDUCATION + 197\n', 'the language, which is the medium of instruction. I feel sorry for these young\n', 'men and women who are really very intelligent but who, because of failing in\n', 'one or two subjects—and it is not altogether their fault but the fault of the bad\n', 'teaching and especially in the subject of English—miss their chance and cannot\n', 'achieve their ambitions.\n', '\n', 'There is another point, Sir, which I should very much like to emphasise; to\n', 'see if an investigation could be made to find out if these people are really stupid\n', 'and unable to manage the course in higher education. There are many people\n', 'who meet these young men and women and who feel absolutely sure that, if\n', 'they were given another chance, taught English by either a European or a very\n', 'well-trained African in the teaching of English, they would get their degree\n', 'straight away without any difficulty.\n', '\n', 'Another matter, Sir, which is in the White Paper on Education in Uganda\n', '1958/59 and is contrary to the recommendation in the White Paper on Higher\n', 'Education and the report of the 1958 Working Party, is on page 16 of that\n', 'White Paper and reads as follows: “To a great extent the curricula and syllabuses of secondary schools are tied by the requirements of the Cambridge\n', 'Overseas Certificate. It has been, and will continue to be, the responsibility of\n', 'each school which offers a School Certificate course to plan its own work.\n', 'Assistance is given.in the form of conferences and refresher courses, arranged\n', 'either at Makerere College for teachers from the whole of East Africa, or at\n', 'training colleges for teachers in Uganda. The help which the staff of Makerere\n', 'College—in particular the Faculty of Education—has given towards the\n', 'improvement of the standards of teaching in secondary schools of the Protectorate has been most valuable and much appreciated. It is intended-that conferences and refresher courses on specific subjects should continue to be held in\n', 'the future, as they have in the past.”\n', '\n', 'This is a very slow development. I feel, Sir, that there should be a definite\n', 'plan and improvement on these two points. As regards Cambridge School Certificate, how can each school plan its own work? And again, unless you have got\n', 'very good, and able teachers to do so, how can we go ahead quickly? This raises\n', 'the question of the Working Party’s recommendations on Makerere College,\n', 'advising on courses being taken in secondary schools. I should like to know, Sir,\n', 'if Makerere College has already started or will be starting very soon this job of\n', 'trying to advise on syllabuses and courses for secondary schools.\n', '\n', 'The last point, Sir, is the teacher training colleges or the duty of training\n', 'teachers. I should like the honourable the Minister of Education and Labour to\n', 'look into the question of teacher training in Uganda, to see if we could not raise\n', 'the standards in many of the colleges, and to see that the teachers receive extra\n', 'time to study the teaching of English. They also need more help generally, such\n', 'as putting the children first before anything else, so that they would be saved\n', 'from failing in their examinations without any good reason. It has been\n', 'expressed several times that Uganda has not a good secondary school system,\n', 'designed to feed Makerere College. I have not made investigations for this\n', '\n', '198 ¢ THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY (1936-1969)\n', '\n', 'statement but I think I have mentioned enough points to make me believe that\n', 'we have not got a good secondary school system designed to feed Makerere\n', 'without difficulty, in turning out students of good quality. I cannot see how we\n', 'can start another university and leave Makerere in the standards of our secondary education, and then see that, at the end of the next quinquennium, the\n', 'Royal ‘Technical College starts its own courses.

The\n', 'compound, as we were to learn later, was often overgrown and at one time we\n', 'cut the grass ourselves. All classrooms were grass thatched, mud and wattle\n', 'walls—white washed—and a number of such temporary buildings went up,\n', 'whenever there was need. Then what was it that people made so much fuss\n', 'about? It was only later as you grew up that you discovered that it was a number\n', 'of so many intangible things, like living and learning, that there is a Gayaza way\n', 'of doing things, like learning to share experiences and improving together. It\n', 'was a spirit of togetherness that bound the whole family together. It was the\n', 'pride of belonging to a school with history, a school so respected by all in society, and a school that taught pride in real values—not materialistic—but we\n', 'learnt to be content with the little we had.\n', '\n', 'It did not take you long to discover that although the Chapel was tucked\n', 'behind the Headmistress’s house, it was the center of life at Gayaza. In the\n', 'Holy Week we took all benches and chairs out and sat on the mats on that\n', 'uneven floor. Each day beginning with Psalm Sunday we acted the event of the\n', 'Day.-On Good Friday we acted a Crucifixion play adapted by Miss Cox from 4\n', 'Man Born to Be King. Miss Pattetson did the costumes; Miss Corby and later\n', 'Miss Galer arranged the music. It was a team production. The parts were\n', 'played by the same people every year; they were only replaced when they left\n', 'school or if one’s behavior did not merit being an actor in a Holy Play. It was\n', 'taken as a disgrace when that happened. Some years the public and parents\n', 'were invited, other times not. Yet each year that play had new meaning for you\n', 'and each year many people were so emotionally involved that they cried at the\n', 'Crucifixion.\n', '\n', 'The dawn of modern times started with the coming of electricity and the\n', 'opening of the new classrooms built in the woods where they now stand. His\n', 'Highness the Kabaka visited Gayaza just after the Art Room was condemned.\n', 'He gave the school a gift of four classrooms. It took weeks to prepare for his\n', 'visit, and we were all excited when it resulted into the promised gift. Talks of\n', 'the new building materialized and we began to see the eucalyptus trees cleared,\n', 'and materials brought in. At about the same time our dormitories were wired\n', 'for electricity. Then the day came, you entered the dormitory, switched on a\n', '\n', '202 + ‘THE Mip-TWENTIETH CENTURY (1936-1969)\n', '\n', 'light, and that put an end to the whole house of seventeen to twenty people\n', 'crowding around one hurricane lamp on the floor in revision time. The school\n', 'programme changed too. We then did our Prep after supper, and the games\n', 'period after tea was extended. It meant too that, if it was your turn to prepare\n', 'breakfast for the school, you had enough time to collect the water from the\n', 'pump near the Konko Valley. We took it in turns to do that and we worked in\n', 'pairs. If you had no strength to bring enough water and collect firewood and\n', 'there was not enough tea or porridge, the hungry eyes looked at you in accusation. This was enough incentive to do the job well. Thanks to the coming of\n', 'electricity one didn’t have to miss “Prep.” We took the event of the coming of\n', 'electricity in our stride. The only strange change for which I have never been\n', 'able to find a justifiable answer was the strict rule set in connection with the\n', 'main switch. This switch was [placed] very high [on a wall]. It switched off all\n', 'the lights in the dormitories and dining room, for our classrooms were then\n', 'grass-thatched and had no electricity yet. The members of staff decreed that the\n', 'light should be switched on at 6:30 P.M. and switched off at 10 P.M. at lights out.\n', 'And so it was.\n', '\n', 'The makers of the decree were the only people to touch the main switch.\n', 'Finding it was too high for any of them to reach, a special stick was designed\n', 'and made by the school carpenter, and with this, only the staff on duty switched\n', 'on or switched off the lights at the appointed time. I was the only one who\n', 'shared this privilege with members of staff—for as a head girl, for two years I\n', 'was the person on duty every Thursday. Obediently I used to walk from my\n', 'dormitory to Bethlehem, ‘the staff house, to fetch the stick, and at 10 p.m. I\n', 'would walk back to Bethlehem to return the stick. I have never known why I\n', 'did not take a broomstick to do it and save myself the walking. At one occasion,\n', 'Busoga College Mwiri [a boys’ school] visited the school. They were to stay\n', 'overnight. We had a concert in the dining room beyond ten. Miss Cox had\n', 'allowed us to have it without the supervision of the members of staff. It was\n', 'done in good faith to give the girls and boys a good time, and as we found out\n', 'later it was a test to see how we could keep the good name of the school in\n', 'mixed company. As head girl I had decided to extend the concert beyond lights\n', 'out and my friends seconded the idea. At 10 P.M. sharp the matron switched off\n', 'the main switch and the boys and girls yelled. We quickly had our conference,\n', 'and decided not to let the Mwiri boys find out that they do this to us—so this\n', 'time, I ran to Augustine and using a broom stick, I switched on the light.\n', '“Temporary fault” we all declared to the boys. The. Matron could not forgive\n', 'me for this misbehavior but Miss Cox did....\n', '\n', 'This period would not be complete if I did not tell you about our class. After\n', 'Junior ITI, there were five of us left and promoted to what we called Secondary\n', '4. We were short of classrooms.

We found ourselves sleeping in one side of the Wilberforce House, a room\n', 'in the middle of the old dormitory of which one side was demolished so our\n', 'classroom was on the other side of the same room. This was to be the home of\n', 'the first School Certificate Class.

She\n', 'declared our diet insufficient for growing brains, particularly for the School\n', 'Certificate Class. This was the beginning of many delicious dishes sent specially from Miss Cox’s house to supplement our diet.

Her account notes that when\n', 'the Germans arrived in Mbulu, in northern Tanzania, her third-born son was “at\n', 'the age of paying the head tax,” which was about eighteen years old. The\n', 'Germans arrived in 1890, although Grandma Genda’s family might have\n', 'encountered them some time later. The earliest events she describes, therefore,\n', 'must have taken place some time in the 1850s or 1860s. Since Grandma Genda\n', 'related this story to her great-grandchildren in the early 1960s, she clearly lived a\n', 'long life. This story was written down by Martha Qorro, Grandma Genda’s\n', 'great-grandchild, specifically for this project.\n', '\n', 'This was a period of famine, and also of epidemics of smallpox, rinderpest,\n', 'plague, and other highly contagious diseases that attacked people and livestock.\n', 'Grandma Genda herself used to refer to this period as “when famine and smallpox met in our land.” In an effort to limit the spread of these diseases, the familes of those who died were placed in a kind of quarantine, in what was known as\n', 'meetaa or meetimaan. People who were away from home when a death occurred\n', 'could not go back home until the period of meetaa was over, usually one year. Up\n', 'until early 1950 the practice of meetaa was still part of Iraqw culture; it ended only\n', 'with the introduction of Christianity and modern medicine.\n', '\n', 'When her mother died, Grandma Genda’s father took her to live with his relative, Manimo, and went away to the land of a neighboring tribe to the south.\n', 'Her life as a child and later as a little girl with the Manimo family was full of\n', 'hardships that included going without meals, going to the stream very early in the\n', 'morning to fetch water, and sitting by the doorstep in the evenings when darkness fell to scare away hyenas while the family was taking their meals. It was a\n', 'time of famine and food was scarce. The geographical setting of the story is\n', 'northern Tanzania between the. land of Iraqw, which is the present Mama Isara\n', 'Ward in Mbulu District, and the the land of Mbugwe, on the southwestern\n', 'shores of Lake Manyara, between Tarangire National Park and the Rift Valley\n', 'wall. Grandma Genda told her story to her great grandchildren often in the late\n', '1950s and early 1960s. This was during the time of the nationalist struggle for\n', 'independence, and Grandma Genda wanted to counter the young people’s repudiation of the British colonialists with accounts of how much she and her family\n', 'had suffered under the Germans.\n', '\n', 'Martha Qorro\n']","['\n', '\n', '\n', 'That day, I went to the stream to fetch water as usual; it was very early in the\n', 'morning.

Then he came out with an\n', 'empty bag, folded and rolled on the lower end of his stick. He put his stick on\n', 'his shoulder and said “Let’s go.” We went—he walked ahead and I followed\n', 'him. We walked until we got to Kitolay slope [rift valley escarpment], then we\n', 'went down Kitolay to the land of Manda [Mbugwe]. The sun was overhead and\n', 'it was very hot.

It helped soften my stomach.\n', '\n', 'I lived with the elderly couple until I grew into a big girl. They had a son,\n', 'Tundu, who was big and strong. Every season the stranger would come, talk to\n', 'the old man, and be given a bag of white millet. He would tell me that I was his\n', 'niece and he was my maternal uncle. He had probably told the old man the\n', 'same lie. On one of the visits—which turned out to be the last—he asked me if\n', 'I would go back with him to Iraqw land. I didn’t like the idea. My new parents\n', 'did not like the idea either. In fact they were very unhappy. I thought I had to\n', 'find a way of telling him off. I thought of that day when he found me near the\n', 'stream and took me to his house. I was very hungry. He didn’t give me food; if\n', 'they had mertimani he could have asked me to take a raw maize cob from the\n', 'shamba [garden plot] in front of their house, or even a migagt [maize stem], but\n', 'he didn’t. What kind of man was this? Where was he going to take me? ‘These\n', 'questions went through my mind and I made up my mind not to go with him.\n', 'So I confronted him with questions.\n', '\n', '“If you really are my uncle, can you tell me my mother’s name? What is her\n', 'mother’s name? And where does her clan and her family live?” The “uncle”\n', 'could answer only the first question because he remembered it from our\n', 'encounter at the stream that first day, years ago. The rest of the questions he\n', 'could not answer. It then became obvious that he was not my uncle, and the old\n', 'man refused his taking me. ‘That was the last I saw of him.\n', '\n', 'Years passed and I became betrothed and married to a man called Matkayko\n', 'Migengi from a rich family with big herds of cattle, goats, and sheep. My day\n', 'began immediately after the first cock-crow, with grinding millet for morning\n', '‘ugali and cooking the morning meal, followed by cleaning the cow-shed, which\n', 'took me to ten o’clock. Then came the grinding of millet for the afternoon meal\n', 'and cooking the meal itself. And when the sun was beginning to move past\n', 'overhead, I had to go back to grinding millet for the evening meal. Before the\n', 'sun went down, the goats and sheep return from grazing. Anything that had\n', 'not been said before that time could not be said and heard until the cries had\n', 'died down. It was difficult to hear each other amid the noise of cows, goats,\n', 'sheep, and their young ones. My major duty at this time was to direct each\n', 'young to its mother. This activity lasted until after darkness fell. Then I started\n', 'cooking the evening meal.\n', '\n', 'After the meal everyone went to bed. I stayed behind to put the dishes and\n', 'utensils away.

She died in 1992.\n']","['\n', 'Lucy Lameck belonged to the new breed of upcountry young nationalist\n', 'politicians who were relatively better educated, in the Western sense, than the\n', 'majority of Dar es Salaam activists. They grew up in areas with considerable missionary influence, where there were many primary and secondary schools, where\n', 'the cash economy was entrenched, and where people had adopted some Western\n', 'values and practices. In Kilimanjaro, Lucy Lameck had also been born into a\n', 'political family: Her mother was a TANU activist who used to host Nyerere at\n', 'her house whenever he was in the area on political campaigns, and she was a local\n', 'leader in the women’s wing of TANU.\n', '\n', 'The text that follows attests to her original and unorthodox perspective. In the\n', 'speech, made in Parliament on June 15, 1965, when she was deputy undersecretary for the Ministery of Commerce and Cooperatives, Lameck emphasjzes the\n', 'need for community self-reliance and sacrifice to the creation of a strong and\n', 'buoyant economy. She refuses to accept the common belief that Africa is “poor,”\n', 'noting that Africa’s wealth and sweat built the economies of the rich countries of\n', 'Europe and the United States. Properly utilized, this wealth could also build the\n', 'local economy of Tanzania. At the time Lameck made this speech, two years\n', 'before Tanzania embarked on the ujamaa program of African socialism in 1967—\n', 'the country was still “groping in the dark,” as Nyerere used to say; Lameck comments on the “confusion” reigning in politics. Lameck, like Nyerere, is struggling\n', 'to find a clear vision of a modern, functional political and economic system that\n', 'will be truly African, reflecting of African realities and values, rather than just\n', 'mimicking the West. In this same vein, Lameck speaks about the need to preserve many “venerable and respectable” African customs, while abandoning others that “retard the development of our country,” and especially the advancement\n', 'of women. In addition to such customs as high dowries, early arranged marriages,\n', '\n', ': AFRICANS ARENOT PooR + 223\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'and female circumcision, Lameck regrets what she sees as a resistance to change\n', 'on the part of some of the Maasai people of Tanzania, who “keep on wearing\n', 'skins and being photographed by Americans.”\n', '\n', 'MM. Mulokozt\n', '\n', '\n', 'Mr. Speaker, we have also decided that in our efforts to develop our country,\n', 'one of our major objectives is to build this country on the basis of self-reliance.\n', 'For this reason I welcome very much the speech of the Honorable Minister for\n', 'Finance and, especially, the new estimates, or the [proposed] new contribution,\n', 'which he calls the development levy, a contribution which, truly speaking, at\n', 'present is only paid by every Tanzanian who earns an income exceeding 10\n', 'pounds per month.\n', '\n', 'I am not in agreement with my fellow members that a person earning 200\n', 'shillings per month or below should not pay anything because his wants are\n', 'many, he has school [costs], children, and various other costs. But Mr. Speaker,\n', 'we must remember two things. The first thing is that if there is no other way of\n', 'increasing national income in general, the numbers of schools cannot increase,\n', 'nor can roads or hospitals. The second thing, in my opinion, is that in times of\n', ""war, it is‘the responsibility of each citizen to tighten belts, for you can't fight for\n"", 'something for which you do not care, and it is the responsibility of all Tanzanians, including those with 10 cents, 20 cents, 30 cents and even 1,000, to tighten\n', 'their belts and contribute something into our national coffers so that we may\n', 'get enough revenue, which will enable us to consolidate our country in the\n', 'coming years, and also to implement self-reliance policies. So I maintain that\n', 'we all have this responsibility.\n', '\n', 'Therefore, in general, Mr. Speaker, I find that these “Estimates of Income\n', 'and Expenditure” have written a new chapter in the history of our country for\n', 'four major reasons.\n', '\n', 'First, they uphold our objective of self-reliance; second, they sustain a permanent basis for socialism; third, they call on each citizen to make sacrifice in\n', 'the great war of revolutionizing the conditions of life of our people and, in this\n', 'way, eradicating the oppression and humiliation suffered in the past at the\n', 'hands of imperialist governments. Last, they also address the fundamental\n', 'objective of putting the country’s economy into the hands of Tanzanians as\n', 'quickly as possible.\n', '\n', 'Mr. Speaker, the question of the economy is fundamental, because if we can’t\n', 'make use of the freedom that we have now to revolutionize the economy, our\n', 'politics becomes useless, aimless, and targetless; our future children will laugh\n', 'at us and reproach us for having failed to use the opportunity we had to lay the\n', 'foundation for the economy of our republic. Hence, it is quite right that a selfgoverning country should make every effort to enable’ it to govern itself in all\n', 'economic matters. In general, I very much welcome the estimates brought by\n', '\n', '224 + THE Mip-TWENTIETH CENTURY (1936-1969)\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'the Minister. I am sure that, after not too long a period, we shall begin to see\n', 'changes in our republic, even though some of us are complaining right now,\n', 'seeing this as a great burden. But what can we do? It is our responsibility.\n', '\n', ""Honorable Mr. Speaker, I have three very brief things to say; hence I won't\n"", 'take a long time. There is one thing which, to say the truth, disturbs me whenever it is talked about by the various leaders in our republic. It is something that\n', 'is often talked about and it bothers me and it is my responsibility to talk about\n', 'it‘here in the House today.\n', '\n', 'Among the words we use when addressing the public, or in various councils,\n', 'is the phrase that “we are poor people,” that our country is still young, and that\n', 'we Tanzanians are “still poor.” This word has been worrying me for quite a long\n', 'time because, Mr. Speaker, I don’t agree at all that our country is poor and that\n', 'Tanzanians are poor people. Our country today has value, it has riches, it has\n', 'culture, it has people, it has agriculture, it has good land, it has animals, different types of livestock, minerals—and it is rumored that there are millions and\n', 'millions of [tons of] coal, iron and other ores—which we have not yet managed\n', 'to find the means to explore and exploit and process for our benefit. Hence, I\n', 'don’t agree at all that our country is poor and, indeed, when we use the word we\n', 'only humiliate ourselves. Today, when I looked at the speech delivered by the\n', 'Honorable Minister, and went over the financial figures for the period from\n', '1960 that he was explaining to us—I can it see here, Honorable Mr. Speaker, I\n', 'will read—I am sorry I don’t have the Kiswahili version, I have the English\n', 'one—Mr. Minister says: “When we took over the government in 1960 the total\n', 'budget under the colonial regime for that year was 19,000,000 ‘pounds for\n', 'recurrent [expenditure] and 6,000,000 pounds for development, making a total\n', 'of 25,000,000 pounds. Today I am happy to say that the Nationalist Government has more than doubled the size of the country’s budget. The total budget\n', 'which I have presented amounts to a little over 36,000,000 pounds recurrent\n', 'and 31,000,000 pounds development, a total of 67,000,000 pounds in one\n', 'year.” Honorable Mr. Speaker, in poor countries people walk [live] on the\n', 'streets, they go without food and die of hunger, they have no farms, no houses;\n', 'they have nothing. One could not use the language used by Mr. Minister here\n', 'in reference to such people. In a one-year period we have been able to raise\n', '67,000,000 pounds. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, we have to be a bit careful about\n', 'the word “poverty,” because we will condition the thinking of the people. Our\n', 'growing schoolchildren, whom we would like to grow in an independent country, should be able to enter the army of the builders of our republic; if we still\n', 'tell them every day that we are poor, we will be debasing ourselves and debasing\n', 'our other foundations. What we lack—and this we have to accept—is that our\n', 'situation is weak because right now we don’t have enough experience and our\n', 'revenue is erratic. The most important resource for us is knowledge: In our\n', 'present circumstances, the government is directing its efforts towards attaining\n', 'expertise in different fields, so that we may disentangle ourselves from this\n', 'problematic situation, and use our new knowledge to explore the minerals,\n', '\n', 'AFRICANS ARE NoT Poor ¢ 225\n', 'exploit our resources, expand our industries, and employ many workers, so that\n', 'we may extricate ourselves from this despicable situation.\n', '\n', 'Mr. Speaker, I think the other thing that makes us feel very poor is the situation of the world in which we live. The world surrounding us is developing fast\n', 'in the economic and scientific spheres: rockets are being sent into space, huge\n', 'buildings are being erected, the condition of life is so different, there are many\n', 'industries, etc. That is why we feel that we still have a long way to go, that we\n', 'have yet to arrive. But I would like us to remember, whenever we compare ourselves to others, the methods used by them to build their countries’ economies.\n', 'The British, the Americans, and others have built their countries from the\n', 'sweat of other people. The British had many colonies in Africa and other lands;\n', 'the Americans had several slaves who cultivated their cotton and other farms.\n', 'The Negroes were, and are up to today, cheap labor. In these countries, the governments belonged to a few people, the rich people ran the governments. They\n', 'used to get materials and other things from our countries. Yes, we are indeed far\n', 'behind, it is true. We are many steps behind, but we must always remind ourselves of the basis and the means these fellows used to get where they now are.\n', 'Let this be an objective and a warning to us, reminding us of our principles.\n', 'Our objective in this country is to see to it that this country develops in general,\n', 'right from the districts, towns, villages, and neighborhoods; that the living conditions in our country change step by step, village by village, and neighborhood\n', 'by neighborhood. That being the case, we have to accept that one of our greatest responsibilities is to tighten our belts and do everything we can in order to\n', 'increase the income of our country, so that our country can develop as fast as we\n', 'are able to make it. At the same time, we have to remember that we have a great\n', 'responsibility towards our republie, that of laying the foundations that conform\n', 'to the needs and experience of Tanzanians themselves: economic, political, and\n', 'developmental foundations for the people and the community which are homegrown and not stolen from foreign countries, but arise from and are in harmony\n', ""with the Tanzanian people's experience and traditions.\n"", '\n', 'Honorable Speaker . . . we are thankful that, when our Central Committee\n', 'of TANU met recently, it authorized the Father of the Nation [Prime Minister\n', 'Nyerere] to appoint a special council or commission to deliberate and advise\n', 'him on how we may formulate a policy based on African socialism. I very much\n', 'welcome the idea, for indeed, it will help us overcome many economic problems.

And as it\n', 'has been said, it is the intention of the government to see to it that customs are\n', 'preserved, and that some are developed, so that they may serve to sustain our\n', 'successive generations and our country in general. But it is openly known that\n', 'there are some customs that very much retard the development of our country.\n', 'Fam one of the many people who shout a lot about this matter, and I will not\n', 'tire of shouting about it, because it is quite clear that such customs retard the\n', 'development of our country.\n', '\n', 'These customs are well known to you, Honorable Members. I know most of\n', 'you married quite a long time ago after paying a heavy bride price—you have\n', 'paid many cattle: That is one of the customs which, truly speaking, don’t help\n', '\n', 'AFRICANS ARE NOT POOR ¢ 227\n', 'us now. And I thank one member who asked a question about cattle: That is,\n', 'how should a person who owns many cattle be taxed? Our cattle have a high\n', 'value in the country, if only they will be utilized, and the government has plans\n', 'for using them in a better way. But there are still such customs of cattle hoarding; people still marry by paying many cattle.\n', '\n', 'Another custom which I know, Honorable Members, is that of marrying off\n', 'our children while they are still too young, still infants. I know that there are\n', 'places where young girls are removed from school, where once a girl comes of\n', 'age, she is removed from school and kept indoors so that she may be married\n', 'off to a man without her consent, and without her knowledge—because customs say so. Indeed there are also some customs that humiliate and reduce the\n', 'beauty of women in our republic—you see women having their ears pierced;\n', 'they have their arms pierced; they are pierced:here, everywhere. Other people in\n', ""some areas have the habit of circumcising girls; such practices aren't good at all.\n"", 'There are other bad and retrogressive customary practices that continue even\n', 'now in several parts of the country.\n', '\n', 'Several local governments, as I have said, have made great strides. I would\n', 'like to take this opportunity to congratulate especially the Rungwe District\n', 'Council, Musoma Local Authority, Morogoro Local Authority, and others that\n', 'I can’t remember now, which in the past never thought about such customary\n', 'issues. For instance ... the day before yesterday I arrived in Rungwe in one local\n', 'authority—where we recently made noise about the hefty bride price—where\n', 'the bride price was twenty cattle, but I am told, the local authority has recently\n', 'passed a by-law reducing it to six cattle. ...\n', '\n', 'The Musoma Local Authority has also passed a by-law on a matter that\n', 'used to exist regarding matrimony. It has been passed, in Musoma Local\n', 'Authority and Morogoro Local Authority, that no father of an underage school\n', 'girl shall be allowed to remove the girl from school to keep her inside or to\n', 'marry her off. This is something that has been outlawed by the local governments, and these local governments deserve to be highly congratulated.\n', '\n', 'Lastly, Honorable Mr. Speaker, this problem of customs does also exist in\n', 'the Maasai area and I would like to remind this house that . . . the Maasai area\n', 'is a very big part of‘our republic; the Maasai people are citizens of this republic.\n', 'We should not accept nor should we be satisfied that they should keep on wearing skins and being photographed by Americans or other people, but we should\n', 'satisfy ourselves that one day the Maasai will change and that they will be just\n', 'like their other fellow Tanzanians.\n', '\n', 'Honorable Mr. Speaker, with those few words, I support the motion.\n', '\n', 'Translated by Satfu Kiango and M.M.

She is, indeed, often known\n', 'unofficially as the “Mother of the Nation.”\n', '\n', 'An articulate, urban, Matumbi-Swahili woman, Bibi Titi Mohamed was a\n', 'ngoma (traditional dance) leader before she became a platform politician; both her\n', 'talents as a performer and her connection to women’s dance associations would\n', 'prove important tools for her political organizing. As a Mmatumbi, an ethnic\n', 'group that spearheaded the Maji Maji struggle against German colonialism\n', 'from1905 toi907, she viewed herself as a freedom fighter belonging to that\n', 'heroic tradition. Born in 1926, she was schooled in the Qur’an , and then had\n', 'four years of further education.\n', '\n', 'Bibi Titi joined the nationalist struggle for independence soon after the\n', 'founding of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) by Julius Nyerere\n', 'and his colleagues in 1954. She was soon prevailed upon to form a women’s wing,\n', 'and henceforth devoted herself fully to the independence struggle. A talented,\n', 'fluent, and humorous Kiswahili speaker, she toured the whole country with\n', 'Nyerere spreading the “good news” of uwhuru (“freedom” in Kiswahili) and gaining\n', 'converts for TANU in the process.\n', '\n', 'By the time of independence, Bibi Titi was easily the best-known and most\n', 'important politician after Nyerere. She became a junior minister in the independence government, and a member of parliament until her resignation after the\n', '1967 Arusha Declaration, which established Nyerere’s ujamaa program of\n', 'African socialism and also codified one-party rule in Tanzania. (She would later\n', 'say that what she objected to most about the declaration was “the undemocratic\n', 'manner in which it was being imposed upon us.”) When she fell out with Nyerere\n', 'in 1969, she was implicated in a plot to overthrow him and jailed for several years\n', 'before being pardoned in 1972. Her spquse abandoned her because of her political activities, and most of her property was confiscated. Upon her release from\n', 'prison, Bibi Titi lived quietly in retirement until the early 1990s, when her role as\n', 'a national hero was once again acknowledged and her properties were returned to\n', 'her. A major street in Dar es Salaam was also named for her. She died in 2000.\n', '\n', 'The following excerpts come from parliamentary speeches, the first made on\n', 'June 14,1965, and the second on July 1,1967. Bibi Titi speaks as the Undersecretary for Development and Culture. She reveals her deep concern for the social\n', 'and economic interests of the common people, especially women, and her sophisticated pan-Africanist vision of African liberation. She also expresses her distrust\n', 'not only of the former colonizer, Great Britain, but also of the Cold War-era\n', 'United States, after two ClA-backed coups in the newly independent Congo,\n', 'and U.S. involvement in conflicts in Vietnam and elsewhere in the developing\n', 'world.\n', '\n', 'Biti Titi’s mastery of both political rhetoric and Kiswahili storytelling, along\n']","['\n', 'SACRIFICES FOR CHANGE + 229\n', '\n', 'with her earthy humor, are discernible in these speeches.

There are no people who sacrifice as much\n', 'as they do.\n', '\n', 'Although we have prepared this budget, the government also needs to look\n', 'into how people spend their money in this country, for our expenditure exports\n', 'money involuntarily; we should also ask our government to exert greater efforts\n', 'to bring in small industries. If people like riding bicycles, why should bicycles\n', '... be manufactured outside this country? Why can’t we make an effort to have\n', 'bicycle industries in our country? Why don’t we make an effort to have radio\n', 'manufacturing industries? There are now many people who like radios, and if\n', 'you go to my home, Rufiji, you will see a woman with her pot or tin of water on\n', 'her head and a radio tucked under her armpit.

Conducted by Miles Lee, and with commentary by David\n', 'Cook, then professor of English at Makerere, the program introduced new writers and writing from East Africa. Kahiga presents a factual account of human suffering during the 1950s, at the height of the anticolonial resistance movement.\n', 'This movement included both political organizing around the Kenya Africa\n', 'Union, and the violent activity known as the Mau Mau uprising. The colonial\n', 'government’s attempt to suppress it culminated in the imposition, in October\n', '1952, of a State of Emergency, and with it martial law. Resistance leaders, including future president Jomo Kenyatta, were jailed, the forests where the Mau Mau\n', 'had their camps were bombed, and tens of thousands of Gikuyu were herded into\n', '“protected villages.” Kahiga’s text deals specifically with the horrific realities of\n', 'concentration camps, where many Gikuyu people were confined and forced to dig\n', 'trenches (some of them literally worked to death), all in an attempt to cut off the\n', 'freedom fighters in the forests, from their supporters in the communities.

They were thatched with grass, and had mud walls.\n', 'All were in rows, one hut about five yards from the next.\n', '\n', 'The rows were separated by pit latrines, about five holes under one roof.\n', '\n', 'Each hut accommodated at least five families, regardless of the number of\n', 'children each family had.

There was no need to ask\n', 'for a second helping even if one felt like it, for these were treats and, as such,\n', 'rarely available. Dinner over, the dining corners are then converted to bedrooms.

The novels capture the troubled state of adolescent life in a society in transition from the tradition-bound\n', 'world to the modern, which is embodied by the values of Western education and\n', 'the search for individual fulfillment. The High School Gent, for example, belongs to\n', 'a subgenre of East African writing in the 1970s aptly called “the university\n', 'novel,” for it depicts conflicted school-aged characters caught between two cultures.

The novel’s implicit message is that self-worth is\n', 'a gift African societies must give their youth, and that gender prejudice, as manifested in the bullying tactics of some of the male characters and in the local\n', ""chief's opposition to female education, considerably narrows young women’s\n"", 'chances for success.

And\n', 'there seems to be little concern over the added onslaught on African culture by\n', 'contemporary capitalist and imperialist forces. The African way of life has been\n', 'left to live, adapt, or die in proportion to its own ability to accommodate or\n', 'fight incompatible foreign influences.

While our governments have continued to give\n', 'African culture an insignificant place in their development strategies, they have\n', 'often aided the influx of foreign cultural influences and their negative impact\n', 'on the African identity. Because of the increased entrenchment of capitalism\n', 'in the last twenty years, Africa is increasingly becoming one culture with the\n', 'rest of the capitalist world—a place where people’s perceptions of the accepted\n', 'way of life are guided by economic gain.and the commoditization of everything, including people. Values based on humanity and the common good\n', 'inherent in some indigenous African cultures are rapidly being replaced by\n', 'values based on money and individual gain. Indeed, the way of life of the ordinary African man and woman is one basically of exploitation, oppression, and\n', 'humiliation. It is a life where morals and values have often given way to tactics\n', 'of mere survival.\n', '\n', 'We are talking of an Africa of lost, split, or confused identities. The confusion is obvious, even at national levels where governments have not yet reached\n', 'a point of defining culture. It is common for African governments not to have\n', 'cultural policies, and many limit their half-hearted attempts at promoting\n', 'African culture to traditional dances, museums, antiquities, and, surprisingly,\n', 'football, even though it is not a sport indigenous to Africa. Culture also seems\n', 'to be the one domain that governments never know where to place in ministerial formations. A look at the African ministerial map sees culture placed\n', 'together with other areas ranging from education, social welfare, labor, youth,\n', 'women, community development, information, sports, and so on.\n', '\n', 'In Tanzania, for example, culture has been shifted to nine different ministries during the past twenty-eight years—an average of a new ministry every\n', 'three years.

This will be very hard for you.” She went on to stress the\n', 'point, “It will be hard for your parents too, who have to be consulted.” Mother\n', 'Kevin would not accept girls into the Convent without their parents’ knowledge.\n', '\n', 'WE WANT TO BE SISTERS + 309\n', 'During her conversation with us she may have felt the spirit of God in our\n', 'sincere request. She asked us to pray earnestly and to think seriously about our\n', 'decision. We went away happily, for at least Mother had listened to us. We did\n', 'not regret the interview. What about dear Mother Kevin? She had a venture to\n', 'ponder about. Very soon doubts came to her and she began questioning herself,\n', '“What am I going to do with these young girls seeking to embrace a life they\n', 'know very little about? What will the future be like?”\n', '\n', 'Although the girls were eager, this had to be seriously considered. They did\n', 'not have the qualities necessary for religious life. They were not educated\n', 'enough. Religious life and their traditional marriage customs were in contradiction. In short, they were too “raw” for the life they were longing to live. It was\n', 'an adventure! it took her time. She had to look up many things. First the\n', 'Bishop had to give his approval or refusal. Mother Kevin searched the laws of\n', 'the Church of that time, which allowed people free from impediments “to drink\n', 'the cup.”\n', '\n', 'His Lordship Bishop Biermans was consecrated Bishop in 1912, after\n', 'Bishop Hanlon had resigned from his office due to poor health. The new\n', 'Bishop was very popular and was welcomed with great joy and love. He was full\n', 'of zeal and courage. He had a population of nearly two million people in his\n', 'Diocese of the Upper Nile. To evangelize all these people, he had thirteen\n', 'priests and seven Franciscan Sisters as co-workers. Mother Kevin went to discuss the matter with him. At first Bishop Biermans thought Mother Kevin\n', 'wanted to train helpers or women catechists like those of Bishop Streicher. But\n', 'no, Mother Kevin wanted to train religious women. The bishop had doubts\n', 'about the idea of making Sisters out of “the new material.” He was aware of our\n', 'traditional customs, some of them unChristian. However, he told Mother\n', 'Kevin that he wanted to interview the girls. This was good news.\n', '\n', 'We went to his house, again led by Paulina. The Bishop looked at us, amazed\n', 'at our ages. With the exception of the three older girls, five looked too young to\n', 'understand what the talk was about. He talked about religious life, emphasizing\n', 'celibacy unknown to the people here, obedience, and mortification. We assured\n', 'him of our wish and determination to try. After the interview, the Bishop and\n', 'Mother Kevin were pleased and more than ever convinced of our sincerity. He\n', 'blessed us. After one week, Bishop Biermans said Mass in the Sisters’ chapel and\n', 'gave us khaki dresses. Despite lack of housing, Mother went ahead. So it was,\n', 'that on May 1st, 1923, the Little Sisters’ Congregation was founded by Mother\n', 'Kevin O.S.F. after twenty years of her missionary work in Uganda.\n', '\n', 'The beginning was not easy. Mother Kevin was laughed at. “She is turning\n', 'first communicants into Sisters,” they said. Others criticized her for teaching us\n', 'English.’The gossip was, “She is making Europeans out of them.” “How are\n', 'they to know God in a foreign language?” Mother Foundress was always modern and up-to-date. She was the first to see the use of higher education for sisters and, as usual, always ahead of [her] time. She knew how education would\n', 'help those who would come in contact with her Sisters, and she was right.\n', '\n', '310 + LATE TWENTIETH CENTURY (1970-1995)\n', '\n', 'In the Sisters’ compound there were four different groups, namely: the convent girls, workers for the sisters, the boarders, the nurses (usually called\n', 'Basawo) and our new group called Badeezi, or helpers. We were very strange to\n', 'the others. We were the girls whom Mother Kevin intended to carry on the\n', 'same apostolates as the Franciscan Sisters. Mother Kevin converted three storerooms into the “helpers” temporary accommodation. Our attire consisted of\n', 'khak: dresses sewn out of simple fashion, a rosary hanging on the left hand side\n', 'on a leather belt, and a medal of St. Francis on a big chain around the neck. We\n', 'felt strange but happy, keeping all to ourselves. We went nowhere, except to\n', 'Church and the gardens. We walked in silence usually in fours or threes and\n', 'occasionally in twos, when going to the garden, but never alone. This new way\n', 'of behaviour caused great curiosity among the three other groups in the Sisters’\n', 'compound and in the villages. Some of those new formation rules were so\n', 'painful and contrary to our culture that people got puzzled about us.\n', '\n', 'This was the beginning of the formation and we had to accept it from the\n', 'start. Mother Kevin told us to have as our aim the glory of God and our own\n', 'sanctification by the observance of the three vows: chastity, poverty, and obedience, not forgetting to pray for the Bishops and priests in the Diocese where we\n', 'worked. She instilled in us the desire to teach women and children.\n', '\n', 'After May 1st, 1923, there were two occasions when more girls joined the\n', 'young Congregation. On July 2nd, 1923, four girls entered. Magdalene\n', 'Nabisoli, who had been teaching the children to read and write; Felistas from\n', 'Naggalama, who had for a long time been with the Sisters; Magdalene Kafuko,\n', 'from Budini Parish, the: first Musoga girl in the Congregation; and Maria\n', 'Babirye, from St. Agnes’ Boarding School. We now numbered twelve, the\n', 'number of the Apostles. “I do not want any Judas,” Mother would say. On September 17th, 1923, the feast of the Stigmata of our Father St. Francis, four\n', 'more girls joined us. Maria Therese was a Mugishu from Nyondo Parish. She\n', 'had come to Nsambya for nursing. She joined the Badeezi but did not stay long.\n', 'Others were: Josephine Nankya. ... Nakamya, a convent girl from Naggalama,\n', 'and Philomena Zikusooka from Masaka, Kitovu Parish. These composed the\n', 'original number of sixteen members in the Congregation. This was the first set\n', 'of Sisters to be clothed and to be professed.\n', '\n', 'Unfortunately, some of the parents were furious with Mother Kevin because\n', 'the group [was] comprised of many ethnic groups. The convent girls and the\n', 'nurses had noticed what they called a mixture. The Luos, the Samyas, the\n', 'Basoga, and Bagishu were sharing the same meal, using the same cups, plates,\n', 'and cutlery. Everything was used in common. To the Baganda of that time,\n', 'such a mixture of ethnic groups was a big insult. The parents felt offended.\n', 'Nevertheless, this was exactly what Mother Foundress wanted and intended to\n', 'foster: Unity in diversity, which has resulted in a rich Congregation of more\n', 'than forty different ethnic groups among the African Congregations. Mother\n', 'Kevin faced the challenge bravely. Slowly, it became easy to believe and live the\n', 'fact that we are all Sisters, children of one Father.\n', '\n', 'WE WANT TO BE SISTERS ¢ 311\n', 'During the early formation years, fresh aspirants found it very hard to wake\n', 'up at five in the morning for meditation.

Her absolute belief in the Divine providence of her Heavenly Father was never shaky. Her devotion to Jesus, His birth, Passion and Resurrection was remarkable.

Its first rays struck the\n', 'fields of snow in splendor. Another gift of their journey was a glimpse of the\n', 'snow-capped Mt. Kilimanjaro far in the distance. With her eyes raised toward\n', 'the summit, Hardei paused in silent admiration for a long moment before she\n', 'could find words to express her admiration: “Proud and royal, how like the\n', 'Himalayas, the abode of gods. Perhaps Shiva meditated here too,” she told her\n', 'son, and bowed in salutation with her hands joined together. “Here some god\n', 'must also live,” she continued, feeling like a child in front of an image of the\n', 'eternal. Who was not inspired by a view of a snow-capped mountain? Kilimanjaro—she did not know its name then—stood with greatness and dignity, a\n', 'monument to aspiration.\n', '\n', 'The heavy and mysterious mists rose slowly, reaching the snow peaks, each\n', 'rivaled in its whiteness. A few seconds later, the snows disappeared, the mists\n', 'had encircled the area. The white mists covering the arrogant summit finally\n', 'seemed to triumph. Kilimanjaro was usually visible until ten in the morning,\n', 'the rest of the day enveloped in clouds.\n', '\n', 'SEEKING My HUSBAND IN KENYA + 379\n', 'The few intense moments had diverted her low spirits. But as the train\n', 'approached the town called Nairobi, Hardei grew nervous again. What awaited\n', 'her here?

We\n', 'were both so young,” she continued half aloud. “He did not even have a proper\n', 'beard, and I was still flat-chested. Who told us what to do? It was so awkward.”\n', 'She closed her eyes, sighing deeply within her soul, remembering.\n', '\n', 'Very soon, even before the color of henna had drained off her palms, Hardei\n', 'was put to work in her new house. She felt sorry for herself: “At least they could\n', 'have waited for the usual bridal period before they asked me to help in the bake\n', 'shop.” It was hard work. Up very early in the morning, she lit the charcoal fire\n', 'and helped to make all kinds of pastries—halwa, jalebis, purees, pakoras. From\n', 'time to time Chacha sent his nephew to Karachi to buy spices. “Better and\n', 'cheaper there,” he had said.\n', '\n', 'The last time Kirparam had not returned from Karachi. Hardei could still\n', 'recall his goodbye. He had not lingered over it. Typical. A Punjabi man never\n', 'looked back to wave in nonchalant sentimentality. A quick “acha” and he was\n', 'gone. She had wanted to shout after him, “Mein £ya, you have forgotten your\n', 'umbrella,” but had restrained herself. The words had frozen in her throat: “Bad\n', 'omen to call someone back.” She thought instead, “He will buy one in Karachi,\n', 'a better one,” and she had smiled to herself then.\n', '\n', 'Karachi was a port full of beautiful things from faraway places—silks, spices,\n', 'sugar, rice, and cereals; indigo, wool, and European goods, and more. In her\n', 'daydreams, Hardei often saw herself in the port of Karachi running from one\n', 'shop to another, admiring the beads, feeling the softness of the silks. “Even if 1\n', 'could not buy anything, just looking would have been so much fun,” she sighed.\n', '“Hai rabba, hai rabba,” she called out to her god not once but many times, until\n', 'she could not bear it any longer. The dream lay shattered before her and tears\n', 'poured forth. “Perhaps he will take me with him the next time that he goes to\n', 'buy spices for the shop,” she tried to console herself. Such was not her kismet,\n', 'for eventually, when she did cross Karachi all by herself, it was in a hurried and\n', 'panicky state, without the leisure she had hoped for.\n', '\n', 'Alone in Miani, day after day she had gazed through the small iron barred\n', 'window for his familiar shadow, for the sound of his quick footsteps. At times\n', 'she caught herself speaking to him, “Mein kya, I say. . . .” She did not use his\n', 'name, of course. “Kirparam,” no, no, she could not have called him thus: it was\n', 'just not done. No wife addressed her husband by his first name, or any other\n', 'name. At other times, to draw his attention, she would say, “Have you heard...”\n', 'Kirparam himself did not often use her name either.

Kirparam did not return from his journey\n', 'to Karachi. She wandered about feeling fetid and forlorn. At such moments she\n', 'felt the loss of her mother. She longed for the assurance of some steady love;\n', 'perhaps a biological need gripped her.\n', '\n', 'Now on the train she awoke with a start, nearly frozen. Clouds had thickened over the sky. Tall trees darkened the forest they were passing through.\n', 'Chunilal drew closer to his mother.

Hardei looked around her—for a familiar face perhaps?

At the far end of the train were the reserved carriages for Europeans\n', 'only, into which no native or Indian would dare to step.\n', '\n', 'New settlers had arrived: civil servants in starched khaki uniforms and white\n', 'topees, others in felt hats.

After studying Latin and obtaining\n', 'the classics qualifications necessary for her admission, she attended and graduated from St. Anne’s College, Oxford. She went on to teach at the prestigious\n', 'Gayaza High School. At Gayaza Sara Ntiro staged a firm protest against unequal\n', 'pay between male and female teachers.

She was the zabagereka—queen and\n', 'wife—of the late Zabaka of Buganda and first president of Uganda, Sir Edward\n', 'Frederick Muteesa I], popularly known as “King Freddie.” She attended Sherbone School for Girls in England, and exhibits the growing tendency of the\n', 'Buganda aristocracy of the time to identify closely with the British colonials but\n', 'also a belief in quality education for their daughters.\n', '\n', 'Sarah Ntiro narrated this early phase of her life—from her birth in 1926 to the\n', 'early 1960s—in an interview she granted to Susan Kiguli in 1999.\n', '\n', 'Austin Bukenya and Florence Ebila\n', '\n', '\n', '\n', 'I was born in Hoima, in the Kingdom of Bunyoro-Kitara. Both my parents\n', 'were teachers in a missionary-founded school. 1 was born on a Sunday morning\n', 'in Hoima Hospital. My mother was taken to hospital in a hammock. In those\n', 'days there were no ambulances and my parents did not have a vehicle. ‘She was\n', 'taken to hospital at the time when people were going to church. The services\n', 'then used to be very long, taking about three or more hours. My mother was\n', 'taken to hospital, had me, and my birth was announced in the church service—\n', 'the arrival of the first child of these two teachers. This was in 1926. My parents\n', 'went on teaching in other missionary-founded schools in other parts of\n', 'Bunyoro-Kitara. I went to Duhaga Girls’ Boarding School in the kindergarten\n', 'class in 1932. Duhaga Boarding School was for the girls who could afford to\n', 'pay the school fees. I do not know if my parents could, but the headmistress,\n', 'who was my godmother, a British missionary called Miss Edith Ainley, was\n', '\n', '384 + INTOTHE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY (1996-2004)\n', '\n', 'instrumental in finding ways of promoting my education. She knew about the\n', 'King George Bursary, which was being given by the government of the day to\n', 'some children to go to prestigious schools, which were expensive and were out\n', 'of reach for ordinary people, like King’s College Budo.\n', '\n', 'That was how J went to primary five at King’s College Budo, a co-educational school in the sense that there was a sprinkling of girls and hundreds of\n', 'boys. But it suited me perfectly, since all my siblings and cousins were males,\n', 'although Budo was far away from home [in Kampala]. But the school nurse,\n', 'who was also the matron for the girls, was a princess of Toro kingdom—\n', 'Princess A. Nyamutoka—and she and my mother had been schoolmates at\n', 'Toro Girls School. She took it upon herself to see to it that I would not feel\n', 'homesick and uncomfortable. I did not know Luganda, which was the language\n', 'spoken in the neighborhood of the school. But Budo had the tradition of\n', 'speaking English. Children had to speak English during the day. I do not know\n', 'whether this was because the government had declared English as a medium of\n', 'instruction and administration in Uganda in 1931 or because it was perceived\n', 'to be an effective leveling strategy in the school.\n', '\n', 'At that time Budo’s students came from all the tribes in the country and\n', 'even beyond Uganda, from Kenya, Tanganyika, Nyasaland [Malawi]. Whatever\n', 'the reason, the use of English was a good idea for learning to communicate\n', 'beyond tribal borders. My father had been at Budo as a student and the children of old Budonians were given priority for entry into the school. In Budo I\n', 'completed the primary part of the school and continued to the Junior Secondary School, then went on to Makerere College about 1946.\n', '\n', 'I was the first girl to go straight from school into the mainstream of the arts\n', 'course at Makerere College, as it was called then. There was some affirmative\n', 'action for people who did not fulfill the required academic standard of entry\n', 'but who were deemed to have the potential for further studies. Such people\n', 'were given a second opportunity by offering them entrance to Makerere in the\n', 'preliminary year and a second chance to take the entry examination. If they\n', 'were successful in the entry examination then they would join the formal First\n', 'Year. ‘When I went to Makerere, we were about a dozen girls, and I stayed in\n', 'what is now part of the Makerere University Guest House. The male students\n', 'rudely called it “The Box” because there were very strict rules for the women\n', 'students, especially about when to go out and with whom to go out. Every time\n', 'we went out we had to sign the warden’s book, even when it was just going to\n', 'Wandegeya. If one had to go out and miss a meal, one had to say whom one was\n', 'going out with and where and state the reason for going out. It was in order if it\n', ""was a known boyfriend, as long as his name was written down in the Warden's\n"", 'Book. At that time there wasn’t this business of just disappearing from the\n', 'Women’s Hostel without telling the warden.\n', '\n', 'Although there was strict discipline, this is something which I really do not\n', 'regret, because J have seen so many girls who did not have that kind of discipline fall by the wayside.

While I was at\n', 'Makerere the warden, together with an education officer, Miss Helen Neatby,\n', 'thought that my time at Makerere had not stretched me academically and that\n', 'I ought to try and go to a well-established university for further academic studies, because Makerere was still a college loosely affiliated to London University\n', 'and only giving certificates and diplomas at the completion of courses. So Miss\n', 'Margaret Graham, who was the women’s first warden, got in touch with people\n', 'in Oxford University and made enquiries about the possibility of entering that\n', 'university. Oxford said that I would be considered if 1 had Latin.\n', '\n', 'When I left Makerere, I went to teach at Kyebambe Girls’ School while\n', 'making preparations to go to Oxford. That was a lovely experience for me\n', 'because my mother had been to that school when it was called Toro Girls’\n', 'School, and we used to tease her that she had gone abroad for higher education.\n', '‘Toro women who had been at school with her were delighted to see Jane’s\n', 'daughter come to teach at their former school. Also, one of the former Makerere women students, Majorie Kamuhigi Kabuzi, was married and was living\n', 'at Nyakasura School, where her husband was teaching. That meant I could go\n', 'to Nyakasura School for weekends. Boating on the volcanic lakes was one of the\n', 'weekend’s delights. In addition, two of my King’s College Budo friends also\n', 'went to Nyakasura School for teaching practice: the late Erisa Kironde, whom\n', 'I had been with from primary five at Budo; and Nelson Mugerwa, who until\n', 'recently was with the Teaching Service Commission.\n', '\n', 'While I was at Kyebambe, there were some expatriate staff who knew Latin\n', 'well and were willing to teach Latin. After passing my Latin examinations I\n', 'was admitted to Oxford University, where I went to read a history honours\n', 'degree. It was an exciting time, a learning experience as wel] as an opportunity\n', 'for interacting with all sorts of people from various parts of the world. The students of East Africa formed the East African Association. This comprised students who came from East Africa regardless of their ethnicity or background.\n', 'There were two students who were the sons of the governor of Tanganyika;\n', 'others were children of British nationals who were working or had worked in\n', 'East Africa; others were children of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika. Somehow\n', 'we all felt that we had a common destiny.\n', '\n', 'I also had a “home” in Oxford because one of the rectors in the neighbouring\n', 'villages had been in Hoima as a priest and at Budo as a teacher doing missionary work. This meant that when other students broke off at the end of a term\n', 'and went to their homes, I also went to my “home.” Since it was a rectory, it had\n', 'a huge house and J had a room to myself where I could relax and keep my\n', 'belongings that I did not need at the university, and I could be a member of &\n', 'family.\n', '\n', 'When I was at Oxford, I made friends with some young Englishwomen who\n', 'are still my friends.

I turned down that offer and\n', '\n', 'FIGHTING FOR WOMEN’S RIGHTS + 387\n', '\n', 'was going to return home without securing any employment opportunity. Well,\n', 'Miss Cox had invited me to go and teach at Gayaza, so on my first morning in\n', 'Uganda I went and formalized the contract. Then I went home to see my parents, father, mother, relatives, and friends. When we got home I had a wonderful\n', 'reception. One of the missionaries working in Hoima and his wife, who had\n', 'encouraged me to go and study abroad, had a huge reception for me, which was\n', 'attended by the whole community—chiefs and their wives, religious leaders,\n', 'schoolchildren, passersby—for my home area people were very excited. There I\n', 'was, at home with my luggage from England, including my bicycle. When I had\n', 'settled down, my mother called me aside and asked me to do her one big favour.\n', '\n', 'She requested me not to ride my bicycle, for only the girls in town who were\n', 'perceived to be loose did that.

I used to watch that bicycle being ridden by a male servant\n', 'going to the market, or even my brother, but not I, its owner. Well, after about\n', 'a fortnight I left Hoima and went to Gayaza, and apart from the domestic science teacher, J was the only African member of the teaching staff.

We worked very well together.\n', '\n', 'One of the problems that came up quite early on during the time I was at\n', 'Gayaza was the salary I was going to be paid (I do not remember the exact\n', 'amount) but it was three-quarters less than what the male counterparts were\n', 'going to be paid. I discussed this matter with Miss Cox and told her that I\n', 'would go on teaching but I would not like to be paid. I did not want to accept\n', 'that which I regarded as an insult. It wasn’t the amount of money, but it was the\n', 'principle: that a man—there was one who had been at Oxford with me and had\n', 'got a lower grade than myself—would earn more than I by virtue of his gender.\n', 'So I decided that I would teach for six months without being paid and then call\n', 'it a day. I knew I had some obligation to do some work within a governmentsponsored school as a way of showing my appreciation for having been given a\n', 'scholarship to study abroad.\n', '\n', 'Before long the story reached Government House at Entebbe as it was called\n', 'then. In Government House the lady of the house was an Oxford graduate lke\n', 'myself. She was outraged that I could even consider leaving the noble profession\n', 'of teaching, but I told her that I could not fight a battle by myself. At that time I\n', 'found out that there was not a single African woman graduate in the whole of\n', 'Kast and Central Africa. Well, the people in power thought it would be very\n', 'embarrassing that an Oxford graduate could not be contained in her home area\n', 'and practice the profession for which she had been trained. They feared this could\n', 'be sending out wrong signals to people who were encouraging girls to go on with\n', 'higher education. So it was decided that, since I was the only one, I should be\n', 'given what I wanted: “After all, she might even get married before long.”\n', '\n', 'From that incident the Ugandan government started paying graduate\n', 'women like graduate men. Later this spread to the whole civil service. Thus the\n', 'principle of equal pay for equal work was launched and established.\n', '\n', '388 + INTOTHE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY (1996-2004)\n', '\n', 'While teaching at Gayaza I was very happy there, and it is only my students\n', 'who might make comments on how they perceived me and how I appeared to\n', 'them. In my second year of teaching, two people who were teaching in my\n', 'home area where I grew up—that is, in Hoima—went to England for further\n', 'studies and were not replaced. So I decided, out of loyalty to my home area, to\n', 'go and teach there and assist the students during the school’s third term, when\n', 'the students were sitting for national examinations. So I taught at Duhaga\n', 'Junior Secondary School from September 1957 to December 1958 and saw\n', 'them through the examinations. But I stayed there for about two years until I\n', 'got married. It was an interesting period also because wherever I went I was a\n', 'new phenomenon. People did not know how to treat me and they never knew\n', 'how I was going to react. About the late 1950s, I became the acting head of\n', 'Duhaga Junior Secondary School.\n', '\n', 'In ¥.W.C.A, we were the pioneers of the family planning association. I lived\n', 'at Makerere as a housewife; my husband was teaching at the Makerere Art\n', 'School. We lived there until my husband was offered a job in London. One of\n', 'the things that happened while I was at Hoima in November 1958 was that I\n', 'was appointed a member of the Legislative Council. Around this time, some\n', 'Americans wanted to put up a school for girls in Uganda. Most of the schools\n', 'then were missionary-based, but the American constitution did not allow\n', 'American funds to be invested in schools with a religious base. So we found a\n', 'way of going around this. The school hall was built with alcoves instead of a\n', 'chapel and each religious group had its own alcove.\n', '\n', 'The other question was whether the school would have enough girls to fill a\n', 'full-blown secondary school. Two of my friends and I convinced the Americans\n', 'that there were more than enough girls to fill such a school. I promised them\n', 'that I would move all over the north of Uganda to sensitize people about the\n', 'need of educating girls and there would be enough girls to fill a secondary\n', 'school. Unconvinced, the Americans decided to put the school near the border\n', 'so that if Ugandan girls could not fill it, they would find Kenyans to fill it.\n', '\n', 'At that time I was heavily pregnant. They were amused and quite rightly at\n', 'my promise to mobilize people too, because we had our last meeting on Saturday morning and I had my second son on that Saturday night. When my second son was born, my husband had been given a job in London and we moved\n', 'on. Then I lived the life of a housewife, which I enjoyed because I wanted to be\n', 'near my sons during the formative years. While at Makerere as a student, I had\n', 'done educational psychology and we had learned how parents were crucial to a\n', 'child’s growth and development. I had grown up with parents who cared for me\n', 'and I did not see why I could not give the same treatment to my children. There\n', 'were also stories about child abuse, which I really did not want to happen to my\n', 'own children.\n', '\n', 'When I was in Uganda, I had a fair amount of exposure by being in the Legislative Council, where some members were elected but others were appointed\n', 'like myself. I was reminded recently that I was the first legislator to talk about\n', '\n', 'FIGHTING FOR WOMEN’S RIGHTS + 389\n', 'environmental protection. The other concerns | took an interest in were girls’\n', 'and women’s education, as well as their welfare and well-being. Some Indian\n', 'women lawyers told me that there wasn’t a law bringing together all the marriage systems. The Hindu and Moslem marriages were not in our statute books.\n', 'So if there was child abuse or domestic violence in those marriages there was no\n', 'way of taking the culprits to court, because legally such marriages did not exist.\n', 'Young Indian girls would be brought in from India for arranged marriages and\n', 'the girls who did not know English, Luganda, or Swahilli were completely\n', 'under the thumb of the mother-in-law, and if they had not brought enough\n', 'dowry, they were harassed and mistreated, and many of them committed suicide, but there was no provision to take the people responsible to court. So I\n', 'brought a Private Members’ Bull motion because African men did not want to\n', 'be involved in other people’s marriage problems. Even though there were\n', 'Indian ministers, they did not want to be labeled people who exposed the\n', 'goings on in the Indian community. So we were the only people who dared to\n', 'point out what was going wrong. Once we had tabled the bill, then all the\n', 'information came in and there was debate and the bill was eventually passed as\n', 'an Act of the Legislative Council and it became law. This is why I am interested\n', 'in the case that is going to be the first case in which a Hindu marital problem is\n', 'going to be subjected to courts of law. Before I brought in the Private Members’\n', 'Bill, this would have not been possible.\n', '\n', 'To tell you about the environment: One would know that an African had\n', 'entered 2 house at Makerere when all the trees and hedges were being cut\n', 'down. Even the Uganda Electricity Board would come and cut down trees to\n', 'install their wires and poles. This was really damaging the environment, so I\n', 'went and raised my concern and asked that there should be a law to make sure\n', 'that people simply should not cut down trees. That was nearly forty years ago.\n', 'Once we had tabled the bill, then all the information came in and there was\n', 'debate and the bill was eventually passed as an Act of the Legislative Council\n', 'and it became law.\n', '\n', 'Loise Kalondu wa Masekti\n', 'A COURAGEOUS WOMAN\n', 'Kenya 2000 Kikamba\n']"
